Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick joins the game with balance: $50
Mistral AI Minstral joins the game with balance: $50

=== New Round #1 ===
Microsoft Phi 4 [microsoft/phi-4] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Starting with a moderate bet allows me to observe other players' strategies and manage risk while maintaining sufficient balance for future rounds."
Amazon Nova Premier [amazon/nova-premier-v1] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Match Microsoft Phi 4's bet to stay competitive without risking too much."
Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick [meta-llama/llama-4-maverick] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I'm starting with the minimum bet to conserve my balance and assess the table dynamics, as other players have bet $10 and one player hasn't bet yet."
Mistral AI Minstral [mistralai/ministral-14b-2512] bets $15
  Reasoning: "Betting $15 balances risk-reward—higher than the minimum but not aggressive enough to draw unnecessary attention, while maintaining a strategic edge over the $5 bettor. It also avoids overcommitting against the $10 players, allowing flexibility for future hands."

Microsoft Phi 4: 8♣ 2♠ (10)
Amazon Nova Premier: J♠ 8♠ (18)
Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick: 7♦ 5♠ (12)
Mistral AI Minstral: K♥ 6♥ (16)
Microsoft Phi 4 [microsoft/phi-4]: Stand
  Reasoning: "The total value of my hand is 10, and the dealer shows a 8♦. Doubling down is not advantageous since the dealer's potential hand can still be strong. It's safer to stand and avoid risk with a weak hand."
  Stands with 8♣ 2♠ (10)
Amazon Nova Premier [amazon/nova-premier-v1]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 18, standing is optimal since it's a strong hand against the dealer's 8."
  Stands with J♠ 8♠ (18)
Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick [meta-llama/llama-4-maverick]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 12 and the dealer's up card being 8, there's a risk of losing if I stand and the dealer gets a strong hand; hitting gives me a chance to improve my hand without a significant risk."
  Drew 9♣ -> 7♦ 5♠ 9♣ (21)
Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick [meta-llama/llama-4-maverick]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 21, I have a strong hand and standing is the best decision to avoid going over 21; the risk of busting outweighs any potential benefit of hitting."
  Stands with 7♦ 5♠ 9♣ (21)
Mistral AI Minstral [mistralai/ministral-14b-2512]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer’s upcard is 8 (weak). Your 16 is safe against a dealer’s bust potential (17+), and doubling risks breaking with a 6, especially with opponents already strong (e.g., 21). No need to chase 21."
  Stands with K♥ 6♥ (16)

Mistral AI Minstral [mistralai/ministral-14b-2512] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting $10 maintains table pressure while balancing risk; avoids overcommitting relative to my $35 balance and aligns with the majority of opponents' bets to observe their tendencies."

Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick [meta-llama/llama-4-maverick]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 13 and the dealer's up card being a Q, there's a risk of losing if I stand, so I need to improve my hand; another card is needed to get closer to 17 or higher to have a better chance of winning."
  Drew A♠ -> K♠ 3♠ A♠ (14)
Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick [meta-llama/llama-4-maverick]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 14 and the dealer's up card being a Q, there's still a risk of losing if I stand, so I need to improve my hand; another card is needed to get closer to 17 or higher to have a better chance of winning."
  Drew A♦ -> K♠ 3♠ A♠ A♦ (15)
Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick [meta-llama/llama-4-maverick]: Stand
  Reasoning: "[Parse error, defaulting to stand] Raw: {"action": "Hit", "reasoning": "With a hand value of 15 and the dealer's up card being a Q, there's still a risk of losing if I stand, so I need to improve my hand to get closer to 17 or higher.""
  Stands with K♠ 3♠ A♠ A♦ (15)
Mistral AI Minstral [mistralai/ministral-14b-2512]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Your hand (8 vs. Q♠) has a decent chance of beating the dealer's upcard (Q♠ ≈ 10) since the dealer's likely total is 10-21. Standing here optimizes long-term strategy with basic rules (Stand on 8 vs. 10)."

Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick [meta-llama/llama-4-maverick]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 13 and the dealer's up card being 10, I need to improve my chances by hitting to get closer to 17 or higher, as standing with 13 is likely to result in a loss. The other players' hands don't directly influence my decision in this case."
  Drew 10♦ -> 3♣ Q♥ 10♦ (BUST 23)
  Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick BUSTS!
Mistral AI Minstral [mistralai/ministral-14b-2512]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer's upcard is 10♣, so you face a 10-value down card (~9% chance of busting). Your **soft 18 (A+7)** is strong, especially since opponents are showing mixed outcomes (19 soft, 18, or bust). Standing avoids risking a bust and maximizes potential win against a likely weak dealer hand."

Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick [meta-llama/llama-4-maverick] bets $10

Mistral AI Minstral [mistralai/ministral-14b-2512] bets $40
  Reasoning: "The table show's cautious bets ($5-$10) except Meta's $10, so a higher $40 bet signals confidence without provoking aggression. This maximizes potential payout while leveraging others' conservative positioning."

  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 15 and the dealer's up card being a 3, I need to improve my chances of winning by getting closer to 21 or beating the dealer's likely total. Since other players have high totals, I'll hit to try to get closer to 21 or at least have a better chance against the dealer's potential total."
  Drew 3♣ -> 5♠ 10♠ 3♣ (18)
Meta LLaMA 4 Maverick [meta-llama/llama-4-maverick]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 18 and the dealer's up card being a 3, I have a good chance of winning since the dealer is likely to need to draw more cards and potentially bust. Standing with 18 is a safe decision given the dealer's weak up card and other players having already achieved high totals."
  Stands with 5♠ 10♠ 3♣ (18)
Mistral AI Minstral [mistralai/ministral-14b-2512]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a dealer's 3▦, your 12 has a low chance of busting (38.2%) and is a favorable hand to hit. Standing risks a 21 on a 17+ (42.2% dealer win), so aggressively chasing improvement against a weak upcard minimizes long-term disadvantage."
