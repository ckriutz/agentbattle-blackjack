Opus 4.5 joins the game with balance: $50

=== New Round #1 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a short bankroll of only 10 units, I am betting the minimum to minimize risk of ruin while reserving capital for essential splits and doubles. Since all stacks are equal, there is no pressure to bet aggressively yet."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a small $50 bankroll and no positional/score pressure versus other players, I’ll keep variance low and preserve capital by betting the table minimum."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $50 balance, starting with the minimum $5 bet preserves bankroll for multiple hands and matches the conservative bets of other players. This low-risk approach allows assessment of the table dynamics before increasing stakes."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With equal stacks and minimum bets from all opponents, I'll start conservatively with the minimum bet to preserve bankroll and gather information about the table dynamics before taking larger risks."

Gemini 3 Pro: A♣ 5♠ (16 soft)
GPT-5.2 Pro: 7♠ 2♣ (9)
Grok 4.1 Fast: 7♥ 5♦ (12)
Opus 4.5: Q♦ 5♥ (15)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 16 against a dealer's 10, basic strategy dictates a hit to improve the hand without risk of busting, as 16 is a weak total against a strong dealer card."
  Drew 9♦ -> A♣ 5♠ 9♦ (15)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 15 against a dealer's King, basic strategy dictates a hit because 15 is a losing hand against a strong dealer upcard and I must attempt to improve despite the bust risk."
  Drew K♦ -> A♣ 5♠ 9♦ K♦ (BUST 25)
  Gemini 3 Pro BUSTS!
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 9 against a dealer 10, doubling isn’t profitable (double 9 only vs 3–6); you need to improve your total, so take a hit."
  Drew 10♦ -> 7♠ 2♣ 10♦ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 against a dealer 10, hitting has high bust risk and only marginal upside; basic strategy is to stand and let the dealer play out."
  Stands with 7♠ 2♣ 10♦ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting on hard 12 against dealer's 10, as standing risks dealer making 17-21 while hitting gives a chance to improve without much bust risk. Other players' hands provide minimal deck composition info at this stage."
  Drew 3♠ -> 7♥ 5♦ 3♠ (15)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting hard 15 against dealer's 10-value upcard, as standing loses to 17-21 more often than busting from hitting. Other players' hands indicate minor depletion of high cards from bust but not enough to alter standard play."
  Drew 6♥ -> 7♥ 5♦ 3♠ 6♥ (21)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 21 is unbeatable except by dealer blackjack or 21, so standing is optimal against dealer's 10-value upcard to avoid unnecessary bust risk. Other players' hands indicate minor high-card depletion from busts but reinforce standing on this powerhouse total."
  Stands with 7♥ 5♦ 3♠ 6♥ (21)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 15 against a dealer's King (likely 20), I must hit despite the bust risk. Standing on 15 versus a 10-value card has very poor odds, and I need to improve my hand to have any chance of winning."
  Drew 6♦ -> Q♦ 5♥ 6♦ (21)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have 21, the best possible hand without a natural blackjack. There is no strategic reason to hit - any card would bust me, and 21 is already the maximum winning hand."
  Stands with Q♦ 5♥ 6♦ (21)

Dealer reveals: K♠ 5♠ (15)

=== New Round #2 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a limited bankroll of $45 and tied for last place, betting the minimum preserves capital while allowing me to capitalize if the leaders overextend."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no count/edge information, I’ll keep variance low and preserve bankroll by flat-betting the minimum. Being slightly behind two $50 stacks doesn’t justify taking extra risk this hand."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $50 bankroll, betting the minimum $5 represents 10% of my stack, allowing conservative bankroll management and more hands to exploit edges over time. Matching other players' minimum bets minimizes early risk while assessing table dynamics."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $50 balance equal to the table minimum bet of 10 buy-ins, I should bet conservatively at $5 to preserve my bankroll and maintain flexibility. All other players are betting the minimum, so there's no competitive pressure to bet more aggressively."

Grok 4.1 Fast: 5♣ A♣ (16 soft)
Opus 4.5: J♠ A♠ (Blackjack)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "A hard 19 is a very strong hand against a dealer's weak 6; standing is the mathematically correct play to lock in a high probability of winning while the dealer risks busting."
  Stands with 9♠ K♦ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20 you’re already at a very strong total, and the dealer showing 6 is likely to bust; hitting or doubling risks turning a winning hand into a losing one."
  Stands with Q♥ J♠ (20)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates doubling down on soft 16 (A5) against dealer's 6, a weak upcard where the dealer busts ~42% of the time, maximizing EV."
  Doubled down, drew 5♠ -> 5♣ A♣ 5♠ (21 soft) (Bet: $10)

=== New Round #3 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Tied for the lowest stack with narrow margins, I am betting the minimum to preserve capital while observing opponents' strategies."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With only a $50 bankroll and no edge information, I’ll keep variance low by betting the table minimum. This preserves bankroll flexibility while we see how others size their bets."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $60 bankroll, betting the $5 minimum preserves capital for sustained play, matching the conservative approach of other players and minimizing early risk in an unknown shoe."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a modest lead of $7 over the lowest stacks, I should play conservatively with minimum bets to protect my advantage while waiting for favorable situations to increase my wagers."
Dealer shows: 3♦ ??
Gemini 3 Pro: 4♥ J♥ (14)
GPT-5.2 Pro: 9♥ J♠ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast: 3♦ A♣ (14 soft)
Opus 4.5: 6♣ K♥ (16)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 14 against a dealer's 3, basic strategy dictates standing because the dealer is in a weak position to bust, while hitting risks an immediate bust."
  Stands with 4♥ J♥ (14)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 versus a dealer 3, standing is optimal since you’re already very likely to beat the dealer’s final total and hitting would risk busting for minimal gain."
  Stands with 9♥ J♠ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy for soft 14 (A3) vs dealer 3 is to hit, as doubling is recommended only against dealer 4-6. Dealer's weak upcard increases bust potential, but hitting improves the hand without over-risking on this matchup."
  Drew J♣ -> 3♦ A♣ J♣ (14)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 14 vs dealer 3 is a standard stand per basic strategy, as the dealer's weak upcard (3) has a high bust probability (~38%), and hitting risks drawing to 17-21 only ~38% of the time while busting ~46%. Other players' hands do not impact this independent decision."
  Stands with 3♦ A♣ J♣ (14)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 16 against dealer's 3, basic strategy says to stand since the dealer has a weak upcard and a good chance of busting. Hitting risks busting myself when the dealer is likely to bust with a 3 showing."
  Stands with 6♣ K♥ (16)

Opus 4.5: LOSE (New balance: $52)

=== New Round #4 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $15
  Reasoning: "Trailing the leader by $10, a $15 wager allows me to overtake their current total of $55 with a single win while preserving enough capital to recover if the hand is lost."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a small $45 bankroll and no need to chase another player’s higher bet, I’ll keep variance low and preserve longevity by betting the table minimum. I can scale up later if conditions look favorable."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With a $55 bankroll, a $10 bet (18%) balances risk and opportunity while preserving capital for multiple hands. Other players' varied bets suggest a mixed table dynamic, so a moderate stake allows observation without overexposure."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With a $52 balance putting me in second place, a moderate $10 bet matches Grok's wager and keeps me competitive while preserving capital. No need to take excessive risk when I'm already in a solid position."

Grok 4.1 Fast: J♥ 9♥ (19)
Opus 4.5: 6♣ 4♥ (10)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Holding a hard 18 is a strong position; despite the dealer showing an Ace, hitting poses a statistically prohibitive risk of busting."
  Stands with K♥ 8♠ (18)
GPT-5.2 Pro has Blackjack.
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 19 is a strong hand against dealer's Ace; basic strategy always calls for standing to avoid the high risk of busting on a hit. Other players' hands do not influence this independent decision."
  Stands with J♥ 9♥ (19)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 10 against a dealer's Ace, I need to improve significantly. Doubling down is too risky against an Ace, but hitting is mandatory since I cannot bust and need to build a competitive hand against the dealer's strong up card."
  Drew J♥ -> 6♣ 4♥ J♥ (20)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 20, I have an excellent hand that beats almost everything except 21. Hitting would be foolish as any card 2 or higher busts me, and I should stand to preserve this strong position against the dealer's Ace."
  Stands with 6♣ 4♥ J♥ (20)

=== New Round #5 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "As the short stack with only 6 betting units, I must bet the minimum to preserve capital and stay in the game while waiting for a favorable streak."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a small $52 bankroll and no edge information, minimizing variance is best; a $5 minimum bet keeps me in the game longer and flexible against other players’ swings."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $55 balance, betting the $5 minimum preserves bankroll for longevity and variance absorption, aligning with other players' conservative $5 bets while allowing strategic play over multiple hands."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the highest balance at the table ($62), I should play conservatively with minimum bets to maintain my chip lead while letting others take risks that could eliminate them."

Grok 4.1 Fast: 6♣ A♥ (17 soft)
Opus 4.5: A♣ J♠ (Blackjack)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Holding an 11 is a statistically strong advantage; despite the dealer showing a King, doubling maximizes the expected return as there is a high probability of drawing a 10-value card to reach 21."
  Doubled down, drew 3♠ -> 3♦ 8♠ 3♠ (14) (Bet: $10)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 is already a strong total and hitting risks busting; basic strategy stands on 18 versus a dealer 10."
  Stands with 8♣ Q♠ (18)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting soft 17 against a dealer 10, as the hand is vulnerable to the dealer's strong upcard and likely pat hand. Doubling is suboptimal here due to high dealer strength, and other players' hands do not alter this independent decision."
  Drew 2♠ -> 6♣ A♥ 2♠ (19 soft)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy requires standing on soft 19 against any dealer upcard, including 10, as the hand is sufficiently strong and hitting risks busting or weakening it without meaningful improvement. Other players' hands do not influence this independent decision."
  Stands with 6♣ A♥ 2♠ (19 soft)

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest stack (only 4 betting units), I must bet the minimum to preserve capital and survive while hoping the leaders take unnecessary risks."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no information about the shoe or an advantage, I’ll bet the table minimum to minimize variance and preserve my $47 bankroll. This also keeps me flexible relative to the other players before I know their bet sizes or any count-driven edge."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $50 balance, betting the minimum $5 conserves bankroll for long-term play. Matching other players' $5 bets maintains a low-risk position at the table."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With the highest balance at the table ($69), I have a comfortable lead and can afford moderate risk. A $10 bet allows me to build my stack while preserving my advantage if I lose, keeping me well-positioned against the competition."

Opus 4.5: J♠ 2♥ (12)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 17 against a dealer's 5, standing is the only statistically correct move as the risk of busting is high and the dealer is likely to break."
  Stands with 9♠ 8♦ (17)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With 11 against a dealer 5, doubling down is optimal because you’re favored to draw a strong total while the dealer is in a bust-prone position. You maximize expected value by increasing the bet and taking exactly one card."
  Doubled down, drew 9♥ -> 2♠ 9♦ 9♥ (20) (Bet: $10)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 7 vs dealer 5 is a standard hit per basic strategy, as the dealer's weak upcard has high bust potential but my total is too low to stand. Doubling is not advisable on such a low total."
  Drew 10♣ -> 3♣ 4♦ 10♣ (17)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 17 vs dealer 5 is a standard stand per basic strategy, as hitting risks busting (over 80% chance of bust on hit) while dealer has high bust potential (around 42%) with a 5 upcard. Other players' hands don't alter this fundamental decision."
  Stands with 3♣ 4♦ 10♣ (17)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a 12 against dealer's 5, basic strategy says to stand. The dealer has a high probability of busting with a 5 showing, and hitting risks busting myself on any 10-value card."

=== New Round #7 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a short stack of $25, betting the minimum is necessary to reserve funds for high-value strategic options like splitting or doubling down."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no information about an advantage (count/penetration/rules), the highest-EV default is the minimum to control variance and preserve bankroll. At $57 vs larger stacks, I’ll keep risk low until I have an edge or a reason to press."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $55 balance, betting the minimum $5 preserves bankroll for more hands and follows conservative strategy seen in other players' $5 bets. This minimizes risk early while assessing table dynamics."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With the highest balance at the table ($79), I have a comfortable lead and can afford moderate risk. A $10 bet allows me to build my stack steadily while maintaining my advantage over other players without overexposing myself."

Opus 4.5: 4♦ 8♠ (12)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 10 against a dealer's Ace, basic strategy dictates hitting because the dealer's potential for a strong hand is high, making doubling too risky."
  Drew K♠ -> 6♣ 4♥ K♠ (20)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20, I have the second-best possible total and hitting would almost certainly cause a bust."
  Stands with 6♣ 4♥ K♠ (20)
GPT-5.2 Pro has Blackjack.
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting hard 16 vs dealer Ace, as standing loses frequently to dealer's probable 17+ hand while hitting offers improvement without excessive bust risk."
  Drew 3♠ -> 9♣ 7♥ 3♠ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy requires standing on hard 19 against any dealer upcard, including Ace, as the risk of busting outweighs potential improvement while 19 is strong enough to win frequently against dealer's likely total."
  Stands with 9♣ 7♥ 3♠ (19)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Against a dealer's Ace, the dealer has strong odds of making a good hand. With only 12, I need to improve - hitting is correct basic strategy here since standing on 12 vs Ace is a losing play, and the risk of busting is acceptable given the dealer's strength."
  Drew 3♣ -> 4♦ 8♠ 3♣ (15)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 15 against a dealer's Ace, basic strategy dictates hitting. The dealer has a strong chance of making 17+ or blackjack, so standing on 15 is a losing proposition - I need to take the risk of busting to improve my hand."

=== New Round #8 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $25
  Reasoning: "With the lowest stack by a wide margin, I must bet the maximum to double up and reach parity with the other players; conservative betting guarantees a loss here."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I’ll keep variance low early and preserve bankroll flexibility, since other players’ bets aren’t set yet and there’s no clear need to swing hard. A $10 bet is above table minimum but still protects my $64 stack."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With a $50 bankroll, betting 20% ($10) follows conservative bankroll management while matching the sensible bet size of GPT-5.2 Pro. This preserves capital amid Gemini's aggressive all-in and allows observation of table dynamics before scaling up."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "With a solid $69 balance and mid-table position, a moderate bet of $15 allows me to stay competitive with GPT-5.2 Pro and Grok 4.1 Fast while preserving bankroll for multiple hands. Gemini is all-in at $25, so I don't need to match their desperation play."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 9 against a dealer's 3, basic strategy advises doubling down; however, with a remaining balance of $0, I cannot afford the additional wager and must hit to improve my hand."
  Drew K♠ -> 5♠ 4♠ K♠ (19)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 against a dealer's 3, I have a very strong hand and standing is the only statistically sound move."
  Stands with 5♠ 4♠ K♠ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 15 against a dealer 3, basic strategy is to stand because the dealer is likely to bust and hitting risks breaking a weak hand. Other players’ totals don’t change the expected value of this decision."
  Stands with 10♠ 5♣ (15)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on hard 14 against dealer's 3, as the dealer has a high bust probability (around 40%) with upcards 2-6. Doubling is not recommended for this stiff hand."
  Stands with 6♦ 8♣ (14)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand

  Reasoning: "With a $40 bankroll, betting the $5 minimum preserves capital for longevity in a high-variance game. Matching the conservative $5 bets from other players maintains table dynamics without unnecessary risk."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a modest lead over some players and near-parity with GPT-5.2 Pro, I'll bet the minimum to preserve my position while minimizing downside risk in this early stage of play."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Holding an 11 against a dealer's weak 6 is statistically one of the best situations in blackjack; doubling maximizes potential profit while the dealer is vulnerable to busting."
  Doubled down, drew 2♠ -> 2♦ 9♦ 2♠ (13) (Bet: $10)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Soft 16 (A,5) vs dealer 6 is a strong doubling spot in basic strategy because the dealer is likely to bust and you have good upside with one card while still having a flexible soft hand."
  Doubled down, drew J♥ -> 5♦ A♣ J♥ (16) (Bet: $10)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 vs dealer 6 is a strong standing hand per basic strategy, as dealer is bust-prone (~42%) and hitting risks busting without improving odds significantly. Other players' hands do not influence this independent decision."
  Stands with 8♠ K♦ (18)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I’ll bet the table minimum to reduce variance and preserve my $44 bankroll while I observe how the remaining players size their bets. I can scale up later if I need to chase Opus’s larger stack or respond to aggressive betting."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

  Stands with 2♦ K♦ (12)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no advantage information (e.g., count), the optimal risk-managed play is to bet the table minimum to minimize expected loss and preserve bankroll flexibility. Others aren’t pressuring the lead, so there’s no need to increase variance."

  Drew 4♦ -> 3♠ A♣ 4♦ (18 soft)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a soft 18 against a dealer's 7, basic strategy dictates standing as 18 is a competitive total and hitting risks weakening the hand."

  Stands with 4♥ K♥ (14)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit

  GPT-5.2 Pro BUSTS!
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit

  Reasoning: "With a hard 15 against a dealer's King (likely 20), I'm in a losing position if I stand. Despite the risk of busting, hitting gives me a chance to improve, and standing on 15 against a face card is statistically worse than taking another card."
  Drew 4♣ -> 4♠ A♥ Q♥ 4♣ (19)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 19, I have a strong hand that beats most dealer outcomes. Hitting would be reckless since any card 3 or higher busts me, and 19 has good odds against even a dealer's King showing."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "As the current chip leader with a slight advantage over GPT and Opus, betting the minimum preserves capital and forces opponents to take the risk to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I’m slightly behind the chip leader and tied with one player, so there’s no need to increase variance early; a minimum bet preserves bankroll while I wait for better opportunities."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $25 bankroll, betting the $5 minimum preserves capital for multiple hands and allows observation of table dynamics. Matching other players' conservative $5 bets minimizes early risk."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a below-average stack of $44 and close competition, I'll bet the minimum to preserve capital. Conservative play is warranted when I'm tied for second-lowest balance and need to avoid busting out before others make mistakes."

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting on hard 12 against dealer's 3, as standing risks dealer making 17+ too often while dealer busts frequently from 3 upcard. Doubling is unsuitable for weak 12."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 16 against a dealer's 7, as the dealer is statistically likely to make a standing hand of 17 or better, making standing a losing play."
  Drew 3♣ -> 6♦ 10♦ 3♣ (19)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 against a dealer's 7, standing is the only logical play as the hand is very strong and hitting has an extremely high risk of busting."
  Stands with 6♦ 10♦ 3♣ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 16 vs dealer 7 is a hit in basic strategy because standing is a long-term losing spot against a strong upcard. Doubling isn’t appropriate here since 16 doesn’t have enough equity and you’d be forced to take only one card."

  GPT-5.2 Pro BUSTS!
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting soft 15 against dealer 7, as standing wins infrequently and doubling is suboptimal against a strong dealer upcard. Other players' hands (Gemini likely stands at 19, GPT busted, Opus weak at 8) do not change this play."
  Drew Q♣ -> 4♦ A♥ Q♣ (15)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 15 against dealer 7 requires hitting per basic strategy, as standing loses to dealer's probable 17-21 while hitting offers bust protection or improvement. Other players' hands (Gemini stands at 19, GPT busted, Opus at 8) do not influence this standard play."

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit

  Drew 6♦ -> 5♦ 3♠ 6♦ (14)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 14 against a dealer's 7, basic strategy dictates hitting since the dealer has a strong up card and is likely to make a hand of 17+. Standing on 14 would likely lose, so I need to take the risk of improving my hand."
  Drew 2♥ -> 5♦ 3♠ 6♦ 2♥ (16)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 16 against a dealer's 7, basic strategy calls for hitting since the dealer is likely to make 17+ and my 16 will probably lose if I stand. While hitting risks busting, standing on 16 against a 7 has a lower expected value than taking the risk."
  Drew A♥ -> 5♦ 3♠ 6♦ 2♥ A♥ (17)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 17 against a dealer's 7, basic strategy dictates standing. While 17 is not a strong hand, hitting would risk busting with any card 5 or higher, and the dealer must hit and could bust."

  Reasoning: "As the current chip leader with $62, betting the minimum preserves my advantage and forces trailing opponents to take greater risks to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a small $44 bankroll and no clear advantage or tournament pressure, a minimum flat bet reduces variance and preserves longevity. Others are betting small as well, so there’s no need to take extra risk to keep pace."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With only $15 balance, betting the minimum $5 preserves my bankroll for more hands while matching the conservative bets of other players. This low-risk approach allows me to stay in the game longer and capitalize on favorable situations."

  Stands with J♣ Q♦ (20)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 vs a dealer 10 is a stand in basic strategy because hitting has a high bust risk and only a small chance to improve to 19–21. Doubling is not appropriate on 18 here."
  Stands with 8♦ J♠ (18)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 15 against dealer 10 requires hitting per basic strategy, as standing loses to likely dealer 17-21 while bust risk is manageable. Doubling is not viable on stiff hand with dealer's strong upcard."

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no information about an advantage (e.g., a favorable count), the best long-term play is to bet the minimum to limit variance and preserve bankroll. Being behind another player isn’t worth increasing risk without an edge."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 16 against dealer 7 is a standard hit per basic strategy, as the dealer has a strong upcard likely to make 17+. Other players' hands show no significant deck depletion favoring standing."
  Drew 5♦ -> 10♥ 6♦ 5♦ (21)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on hard 21 against dealer 7 is optimal, as it's a winning hand barring dealer blackjack, and hitting risks busting. Other players' hands (one bust, two stands under 21) provide no deck composition info favoring a hit."
  Stands with 10♥ 6♦ 5♦ (21)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5

  Stands with Q♣ 9♠ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a soft 17 (A,6) against a dealer 4, basic strategy favors doubling to maximize value since the dealer is in a weak upcard range and you can improve safely with one card."

=== New Round #25 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "As the current chip leader, betting the minimum minimizes variance and forces trailing opponents to over-bet and take risks to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no edge information (count/penetration), I’ll bet the table minimum to minimize variance and preserve my small $44 bankroll. I’m not pressured by relative stacks in a cash game, so low risk is optimal."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a low balance of $25, betting the minimum $5 preserves bankroll for more hands and reduces risk of quick elimination. Matching other players' conservative $5 bets maintains table dynamics without overextending."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a modest bankroll of $69 and currently in second place, I'll bet the minimum to preserve my stack while waiting for favorable situations. Conservative play is optimal when I'm already positioned well relative to most opponents."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Holding a hard 17 against a dealer's 10-value card requires standing, as hitting has a high probability of busting."
  Stands with 8♥ 9♠ (17)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 13 vs dealer 10 is a clear hit in basic strategy because standing is a big underdog against a strong dealer upcard. Doubling isn’t appropriate with this total."
  Drew A♠ -> 3♣ K♥ A♠ (14)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "This is a hard 14 (the A must count as 1) against a dealer 10, which is a clear hit in basic strategy since standing is a significant underdog. Doubling isn’t available/appropriate on 14 here."
  Drew 5♣ -> 3♣ K♥ A♠ 5♣ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 19 is a strong total and should always stand, even against a dealer 10, since hitting risks busting for minimal improvement."
  Stands with 3♣ K♥ A♠ 5♣ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 6 against dealer's 10 is a losing stand; basic strategy requires hitting to seek improvement without bust risk. Doubling is never optimal on such a weak hand."
  Drew 4♣ -> 2♦ 4♦ 4♣ (10)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 10 vs dealer 10 requires hitting per basic strategy, as standing loses to dealer's probable strong hand (17+), while hitting offers improvement potential with low immediate bust risk. Other players' hands (two strong, one weak) don't alter independent optimal play."
  Drew 8♠ -> 2♦ 4♦ 4♣ 8♠ (18)

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 7 against a dealer's Queen, I must hit since I cannot bust and need to improve significantly. Standing on 7 would almost certainly lose, and doubling down is too risky with such a low starting total."
  Drew J♦ -> 2♠ 5♦ J♦ (17)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 17 against a dealer's Queen, hitting risks busting with any card 5 or higher. While 17 is a weak hand, basic strategy dictates standing on hard 17 and hoping the dealer busts."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader, betting the minimum minimizes variance and forces the close runner-up, Opus 4.5, to over-bet or take risks to catch me."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "In a cash-game style situation there’s no advantage to “catching up” to other balances, so I’ll keep variance low and preserve bankroll. With only $44, betting the $5 minimum maximizes longevity and flexibility for favorable spots."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With only $20 balance, betting the minimum $5 preserves bankroll for multiple hands and minimizes risk of early elimination, especially as other players are conservatively betting low."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a comfortable middle-of-the-pack position at $64 and the short stack (Grok) only at $20, I should play conservatively with minimum bets to maintain my position while letting variance potentially eliminate weaker stacks."

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 12 versus a dealer 7 is a clear hit in basic strategy since standing gives up too much equity against the dealer’s strong upcard. Doubling on 12 isn’t warranted."
  Drew 8♦ -> 6♦ 6♣ 8♦ (20)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20 you should always stand, regardless of the dealer’s 7, since hitting risks busting and only improves to 21."
  Stands with 6♦ 6♣ 8♦ (20)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting hard 12 against dealer 7, as standing loses more often to dealer's probable 17-21 while hitting offers improvement without high bust risk on low cards."
  Drew 7♥ -> 9♥ 3♠ 7♥ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 19 is an extremely strong hand against dealer's 7, where basic strategy always dictates standing to preserve the hand's value, as the dealer is likely to reach 17-21 but has no edge over 19. Hitting risks immediate bust on any card 3 or higher with negligible upside."
  Stands with 9♥ 3♠ 7♥ (19)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 16 against a dealer's 7, basic strategy calls for hitting. I can't bust with one card since the Ace can convert to 1, and I need to improve my hand since 16 likely won't beat a dealer showing 7."
  Drew J♠ -> A♠ 5♠ J♠ (16)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 16 against a dealer's 7, basic strategy recommends hitting since the dealer has a strong chance of making 17 or better. Standing on 16 is statistically worse than risking a bust, as I need to improve to have a realistic chance of winning."

  Reasoning: "As the current chip leader, betting the minimum preserves my lead and forces trailing opponents to take risks to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $49 bankroll and no immediate need to swing for the lead against $74, I’ll keep variance low and preserve capital by betting the minimum. This also maintains flexibility to size up later if I fall behind or get a favorable situation."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates doubling a hard 9 against a dealer's 6 to capitalize on the dealer's high bust probability. Furthermore, with many low cards visible on the table, the deck is rich in 10-value cards, increasing the odds of drawing a strong 19."
  Doubled down, drew A♥ -> 3♥ 6♥ A♥ (20 soft) (Bet: $10)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With 11 against a dealer 6, doubling down is optimal since you’re favored to make a strong total while the dealer has a high bust chance. The extra bet has positive expected value in this matchup."
  Doubled down, drew A♠ -> 3♥ 8♣ A♠ (12) (Bet: $10)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: DoubleDown

  Stands with 8♣ 6♦ (14)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand

  Stands with 9♥ 7♥ (16)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with a $25 buffer, betting the minimum minimizes variance and forces opponents to take risks to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no count/edge information, optimal risk-adjusted play is to keep variance low and bet the table minimum. I’m slightly behind one player, but pressing without an advantage is negative-EV."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $45 balance, betting the minimum $5 preserves bankroll for more hands and follows conservative play amid other players' small bets, reducing risk of early elimination."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a limited $69 balance tied with GPT-5.2 Pro and behind Gemini 3 Pro, I'll bet conservatively at the minimum to preserve my stack and wait for favorable opportunities rather than taking unnecessary risks early."

Grok 4.1 Fast: K♥ 9♣ (19)
Opus 4.5: 8♥ 2♦ (10)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 16 against a dealer Ace, basic strategy dictates a hit as I cannot bust and 16 is likely a losing total. The slightly negative running count confirms there is no advantage to deviate from standard play."
  Drew J♠ -> A♣ 5♦ J♠ (16)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Holding a hard 16 against a dealer Ace is a losing position, making a hit necessary per basic strategy to attempt to improve. The negative running count suggests a slight abundance of low cards, marginally increasing the chance of surviving the hit."
  Drew 9♦ -> A♣ 5♦ J♠ 9♦ (BUST 25)
  Gemini 3 Pro BUSTS!
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 18 (A,7) vs dealer Ace is a hit in basic strategy because the dealer has a strong upcard and standing leaves you too often behind; you can improve without busting on one card."
  Drew K♦ -> A♥ 7♥ K♦ (18)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "After the hit, this is now a hard 18 vs a dealer Ace, and basic strategy is to stand since hitting busts on 4 or higher and the upside is small."
  Stands with A♥ 7♥ K♦ (18)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 19 against dealer's Ace is a strong hand; basic strategy recommends standing to minimize bust risk. Hitting or doubling could easily exceed 21 or lose more on a solid total."
  Stands with K♥ 9♣ (19)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 10 against a dealer's Ace, I need to improve my hand. Doubling down isn't advisable here since the dealer shows an Ace (strong position), and standing on 10 would almost certainly lose. I'll hit to try to build a competitive hand."
  Drew J♦ -> 8♥ 2♦ J♦ (20)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 20, I have an excellent hand that beats most dealer outcomes. Hitting would be extremely risky since only an Ace improves my hand while any card 2-10 or face card busts me."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 16 against the dealer's weak 3 upcard, basic strategy dictates standing to avoid busting, hoping the dealer goes over 21."
  Stands with 6♥ J♠ (16)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 16 (A,5) against a dealer 3, basic strategy is to hit since doubling is typically reserved for dealer 4–6 and you can’t bust by taking one card."
  Drew 8♠ -> A♣ 5♥ 8♠ (14)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "After the 8, your hand is a hard 14 (Ace counted as 1). Basic strategy stands on hard 13–16 versus a dealer 2–6 (including 3) because the dealer is more likely to bust than you are to improve safely."
  Stands with A♣ 5♥ 8♠ (14)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy for soft 16 (A5) vs dealer 3 is to hit, as doubling is optimal only against 4-6 where dealer busts more frequently; hitting improves the hand without excessive risk against this weak upcard."
  Drew 5♣ -> 5♦ A♣ 5♣ (21 soft)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Soft 21 is an excellent hand that beats most dealer outcomes; basic strategy always calls for standing on soft 21 against any upcard, including dealer's 3, to preserve the strong total without risk of busting."
  Stands with 5♦ A♣ 5♣ (21 soft)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand

  Reasoning: "With no edge information (count/rules) and a small bankroll, I’ll minimize variance and preserve funds by betting the table minimum. Gemini’s $5 bet suggests a cautious pace, so there’s no need to take extra risk."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

Opus 4.5: Q♣ 6♠ (16)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 15 against a dealer's 10, as the dealer is statistically likely to have a higher total and standing is a losing play."
  Drew 4♥ -> Q♠ 5♣ 4♥ (19)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 against a dealer's 10, basic strategy dictates standing as I have a strong total that beats the dealer's average hand."
  Stands with Q♠ 5♣ 4♥ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Soft 19 (A,8) is already a strong total and is typically stood on against a dealer 10; hitting risks turning it into a weaker hard hand without much upside. Doubling isn’t indicated here versus a 10."
  Stands with 8♦ A♦ (19 soft)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Hard 11 against dealer 10 is a prime doubling spot per basic strategy, offering the highest EV by taking one card with minimal bust risk and strong potential to beat dealer's likely stiff hand."
  Doubled down, drew 9♦ -> 5♠ 6♣ 9♦ (20) (Bet: $10)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 16 against a dealer's Jack, basic strategy dictates hitting since the dealer has a strong up card and is likely to make 17-21. Standing on 16 versus a 10-value card loses more often than hitting, despite the risk of busting."
  Drew 5♠ -> Q♣ 6♠ 5♠ (21)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have 21, the best possible hand without a natural blackjack. There is no strategic reason to hit - any card would either bust me or be impossible since 21 is the maximum."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand

  Stands with 8♠ K♣ (18)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With 9 vs a dealer 3, basic strategy calls for doubling because the dealer is in a weak upcard range and you have strong equity to improve with one card."
  Doubled down, drew 2♠ -> 4♦ 5♥ 2♠ (11) (Bet: $10)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 8 against dealer's weak 3 requires hitting per basic strategy to improve the hand without bust risk. Doubling is inappropriate for such a low total, and standing loses to dealer's likely strong finish."
  Drew 3♦ -> 5♦ 3♣ 3♦ (11)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 11 vs. dealer's 3 requires hitting per basic strategy to chase a strong total, as standing loses to dealer's likely 17-21 while bust risk remains low. Doubling would be ideal but unavailable after initial hit."
  Drew 4♣ -> 5♦ 3♣ 3♦ 4♣ (15)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 15 vs. dealer's 3 requires standing per basic strategy, as dealer busts ~37% of the time with a 3 upcard while further hitting risks busting without sufficient upside. Other players' strong hands (18, 20) support avoiding unnecessary risk."
  Stands with 5♦ 3♣ 3♦ 4♣ (15)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand

  Reasoning: "As the current chip leader, betting the minimum minimizes risk while forcing trailing opponents to over-bet or get lucky to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no edge information (count/rules/shoe state), the best default is to minimize variance and preserve bankroll by flat-betting the table minimum. I’m not far behind the leader, so there’s no need to take extra risk yet."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $40 bankroll, betting the $5 minimum represents conservative bankroll management (12.5% risk per hand) to maximize hands played and survive variance. Matching other players' low bets aligns with the table's cautious dynamic."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit

  Drew 5♣ -> 7♣ 7♣ 5♣ (19)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "A hard 19 is a strong hand against any dealer up card; hitting creates an extremely high probability of busting."
  Stands with 7♣ 7♣ 5♣ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With soft 17 (A,6) against a dealer 10, standing is too weak and doubling isn’t standard; you should hit to try to improve while you can’t bust with one card due to the ace."
  Drew A♣ -> A♥ 6♦ A♣ (18 soft)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 18 (A,6,A) versus a dealer 10 is a hit in basic strategy because standing is usually behind and you can’t bust on one card due to the ace flexibility."
  Drew 6♣ -> A♥ 6♦ A♣ 6♣ (14)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "This is a hard 14 (no usable ace) against a dealer 10, which is a clear hit in basic strategy since standing loses too often. You need to improve your total to have a realistic chance versus the dealer’s strong upcard."
  Drew 7♦ -> A♥ 6♦ A♣ 6♣ 7♦ (21)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 vs dealer 10 is a standard stand per basic strategy, as hitting risks busting (over 50% chance) while dealer has a strong upcard. Other players' hands (one blackjack, one 19, one weak 6) provide no actionable insight for deviation."
  Stands with 10♠ 8♣ (18)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 6 against a dealer's King, I must hit since I cannot bust and need to improve significantly. Doubling down on 6 is too risky even though the dealer shows a strong card."

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 16 against a dealer's King, I'm in a losing position if I stand since the dealer likely has 20. Basic strategy says to hit 16 against a 10-value card despite the bust risk, as standing has even worse expected value."

  Stands with 7♥ 10♠ (17)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 14 vs a dealer Ace is a clear hit in basic strategy since standing is a long-term losing position against a strong upcard. Doubling isn’t appropriate on 14."
  Drew 7♠ -> 8♥ 6♣ 7♠ (21)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit

  Reasoning: "With a mid-range stack of $79, I'll bet $10 to stay competitive with Gemini 3 Pro who leads at $99, while maintaining enough bankroll for recovery if I lose. Conservative but slightly above minimum keeps me in contention without excessive risk."

Opus 4.5: Q♥ 8♣ (18)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 14 against a dealer's 2, basic strategy dictates standing to avoid the high risk of busting, hoping the dealer busts on their weak up card."
  Stands with K♥ 4♣ (14)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 17 should always stand; hitting risks busting and the dealer’s 2 is a weak upcard that often forces the dealer to draw and bust."
  Stands with 7♠ Q♠ (17)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting hard 13 against dealer's 2, as the dealer has a weak upcard but high bust potential if they improve poorly. Standing risks the dealer making 17+, and doubling is not viable on 13."
  Drew 3♥ -> 8♠ 5♥ 3♥ (16)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting hard 16 against dealer's 2, as the dealer has a weak upcard with high potential to reach 17+ without busting often, while standing risks losing to a dealer pat hand. Other players' hands do not influence this independent decision."
  Drew 5♦ -> 8♠ 5♥ 3♥ 5♦ (21)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 21 is a pat hand that wins against any dealer total under 22, so standing is mandatory per basic strategy to avoid unnecessary bust risk. Dealer's weak 2 upcard increases their chance of busting or making a weaker hand, making this optimal."
  Stands with 8♠ 5♥ 3♥ 5♦ (21)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 18 against a dealer's 2, standing is the correct basic strategy play. While a 2 is a decent starting card for the dealer, hitting an 18 risks busting with any card 4 or higher, and the expected value of standing is significantly better."

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With $69 I'm in third place, so I need to be slightly aggressive to catch up to Gemini 3 Pro's $94 lead. A $10 bet doubles the minimum without risking too much of my stack, allowing for splits or doubles if needed."

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I’ll keep variance low and preserve bankroll since there’s no edge or count information and the table stakes from others are minimal. A minimum bet also lets me stay in the game longer to adjust if conditions improve."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting hard 13 against dealer's 3, as standing leaves a stiff hand vulnerable to the dealer's likely improvement without busting, while hitting has good equity against this weak upcard."

  Drew 7♦ -> 4♦ 3♣ 7♦ (14)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 14 against a dealer's 3, basic strategy actually suggests standing since the dealer has a higher chance of busting with a weak upcard. However, 14 is still a vulnerable hand, and while hitting risks busting, the dealer's 3 gives them decent chances of making a hand. I'll hit to try improving, accepting the bust risk."

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand

  Stands with 8♠ 9♣ (17)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Soft 20 is already a very strong total, and against a dealer 4 (a bust-prone upcard) the highest-EV play is to stand and let the dealer draw out."
  Stands with A♥ 9♠ (20 soft)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Hard 10 against dealer's weak 4 upcard (high dealer bust probability ~40%) is optimal for doubling down per basic strategy to maximize expected value. Other players' hands do not influence this independent decision."

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a small $86 bankroll and no immediate advantage information (count/edge), the best long-run move is to minimize variance and expected loss by betting the table minimum. I’m not in a must-catch situation versus others, so there’s no need to take extra risk."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Since splitting is not an available option, I must treat this pair of Aces as a soft 12. Hitting is the standard play to improve the hand without risk of busting, as doubling offers poor equity starting from a total of 2."

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand

  Stands with 6♥ 8♣ (14)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 10 against dealer Ace requires hitting per basic strategy, as standing is too weak and doubling risks too much against the strong upcard."
  Drew Q♦ -> 2♠ 8♦ Q♦ (20)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 20 against dealer Ace is a strong hand; basic strategy mandates standing, as hitting risks busting while standing maximizes win probability regardless of other players' hands."
  Stands with 2♠ 8♦ Q♦ (20)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Against a dealer's Ace, I need a stronger hand than 13. Basic strategy dictates hitting on 13 vs Ace since the dealer has a high probability of making a strong hand, and I need to improve despite the bust risk."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "As the current chip leader, betting the minimum minimizes variance and preserves my advantage while forcing trailing opponents to take risks to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no edge information (count/pen/rules), the optimal risk-managed move is to bet the minimum and preserve bankroll. Being only $10 behind the chip leader doesn’t justify increasing variance yet."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $70 bankroll, betting the $5 minimum is conservative at ~7% of balance, preserving capital for long-term play. Matching other players' small bets reduces early variance while assessing table dynamics."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table ($54 vs others' $70-$113), I need to play conservatively to stay in the game. Minimum bets preserve my bankroll and allow me to wait for better opportunities to catch up."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "A hard 20 is an extremely strong hand that should never be hit or doubled; standing is the only statistically correct move, especially against a dealer's weak 4."
  Stands with Q♣ 10♥ (20)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 16 against a dealer 4, standing is best since the dealer is in a weak bust range and hitting risks busting. If splitting were allowed I’d split 8s, but given these options, Stand has the highest expectation."
  Stands with 8♠ 8♥ (16)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on hard 16 against dealer's 4, as the dealer has a weak upcard likely to bust (40%+ probability). Doubling is inappropriate for 16, and hitting risks busting with a stiff hand."
  Stands with K♠ 6♣ (16)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 16 against a dealer's 4, basic strategy says to stand. The dealer has a high chance of busting with a 4 showing, and hitting my 16 risks busting myself with any card 6 or higher."

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I’m slightly behind the table leader and don’t need to take on extra variance yet, so I’ll keep risk low and preserve bankroll with the minimum bet. I can scale up later if the count/edge improves or if I need to catch up."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $65 bankroll, betting the minimum $5 preserves capital for more hands and follows conservative bankroll management against the house edge. Matching other players' conservative bets allows observation of table dynamics before increasing risk."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5

  Stands with J♥ Q♣ (20)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With A,A (soft 12) you should keep drawing since you can’t bust with one hit and standing is far too weak versus a dealer 2. Splitting would be best but isn’t available, so Hit is the optimal substitute."
  Drew 2♦ -> A♣ A♠ 2♦ (14 soft)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 14 vs a dealer 2 is too weak to stand on, and you can’t bust with one hit. Without the option to double, the optimal play is to keep hitting to improve your total."
  Drew 8♦ -> A♣ A♠ 2♦ 8♦ (12)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 12 vs a dealer 2 is a hit in basic strategy because standing is too weak and you still have plenty of non-busting improvement cards. You only bust with a 10-value card."
  Drew 4♦ -> A♣ A♠ 2♦ 8♦ 4♦ (16)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 16 vs a dealer 2 is a stand in basic strategy because the dealer has a high bust rate with a weak upcard and hitting risks busting on any 6+."

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "No information about deck conditions or an advantage, so I’ll keep variance low and preserve bankroll with the minimum. I’m slightly behind the table leader, so there’s no need to chase with a larger bet yet."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

  Stands with K♠ 2♦ 7♥ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 18 against a dealer's Queen, standing is the correct play. While the dealer likely has a strong hand, hitting risks busting with any card 4 or higher, and 18 is a reasonable holding that can still win if the dealer busts or has 17."

Opus 4.5: LOSE (New balance: $44)

=== New Round #56 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader, I am betting the minimum to preserve my stack and force trailing opponents to take risks to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no information edge (count/shoe state), the optimal long-run play is to keep variance low and bet the table minimum. I’m slightly behind the chip leader, but escalating bets without an advantage is negative EV and risks my $98 stack unnecessarily."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a low balance of $55, betting the minimum $5 preserves bankroll for more hands and follows strict money management (under 10% risk per hand). Matching other players' conservative $5 bets maintains table dynamics without unnecessary risk."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table ($44 vs others' $55-118), I need to play conservatively to stay in the game. Minimum bets preserve my bankroll and give me more hands to recover."

Opus 4.5: 5♦ 6♠ (11)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "According to basic strategy, a hard 15 against a dealer's 2 is a stand because the risk of busting is high and the dealer is in a weak position."
  Stands with K♦ 5♥ (15)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20 you should stand against any dealer upcard, including 2, since hitting or doubling only risks busting while offering minimal upside."
  Stands with J♥ Q♦ (20)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 20 is one of the strongest hands in blackjack and always stands against any dealer upcard, including a weak 2; no need to hit or double as it risks busting without improving odds significantly."
  Stands with J♦ K♦ (20)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With 11 against a dealer's 2, this is a textbook double down situation. I have the best possible hand to double on, and while the dealer's 2 isn't the weakest up card, the expected value of doubling here is strongly positive."

  Reasoning: "As the current chip leader, betting the minimum minimizes variance and preserves my stack while forcing trailing opponents to take risks to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no count/edge information, I’ll keep variance low and preserve bankroll by flat-betting the minimum. I’m already near the top of the table, so there’s no need to risk more to maintain position."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $60 bankroll, betting the $5 minimum preserves capital for variance while matching the conservative bets of other players, allowing me to assess the table and shoe without unnecessary risk."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5

  Drew 5♣ -> 3♥ 3♥ 5♣ (11)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a total of 11 against a dealer Ace, hitting is the mandatory play to maximize the chance of a strong final hand, especially since doubling is not allowed after hitting."
  Drew 6♣ -> 3♥ 3♥ 5♣ 6♣ (17)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 17, basic strategy dictates standing regardless of the dealer's up card, as the probability of busting by hitting is significantly higher than the chance of improving."

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 13 against a dealer Ace is a strong disadvantage; basic strategy calls for hitting because standing loses too often to dealer 17+."
  Drew 2♣ -> 6♣ 7♦ 2♣ (15)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 15 versus a dealer Ace is a losing stand; basic strategy is to hit since the dealer is likely to make 17+ and you need to improve."

  Stands with 9♣ 9♠ (18)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 20 against a dealer's Ace, I have an excellent hand that wins against most dealer outcomes. Hitting or doubling would be reckless since any card except an Ace would bust me, and even basic strategy strongly recommends standing on 20."

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I’m slightly behind the table leader and well ahead of two others, so there’s no need to spike variance early. A minimum bet preserves bankroll while I wait for higher-confidence situations to press."

  Stands with 9♣ J♦ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit

  Drew 5♠ -> 6♠ A♠ 5♠ (12)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Holding a hard 12 against a dealer's King (10) requires a hit according to basic strategy, as standing leaves me with a very weak total against a strong dealer card."
  Drew 8♠ -> 6♠ A♠ 5♠ 8♠ (20)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20 against a dealer's King, standing is the only logical move as it preserves a very strong hand that is highly likely to win or push."
  Stands with 6♠ A♠ 5♠ 8♠ (20)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 13 against a dealer 10, basic strategy calls for hitting because standing is a long-term losing spot. Doubling isn’t appropriate since 13 is too weak to justify increasing the bet."
  Drew A♦ -> 9♥ 4♦ A♦ (14)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "This is a hard 14 (the Ace must count as 1), and basic strategy says to hit hard 14 vs a dealer 10 because standing is too weak against likely dealer totals."

  GPT-5.2 Pro BUSTS!
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 8 against dealer's 10 is a clear hit per basic strategy, as standing almost certainly loses while another card offers improvement without high bust risk. Other players' strong hands don't change this fundamental play."
  Drew Q♦ -> 6♥ 2♦ Q♦ (18)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 vs. dealer's 10 is a clear basic strategy stand, as hitting risks immediate bust on 60%+ of cards while standing preserves equity against dealer's probable strong hand. Other players' hands (20, bust, 19) do not alter this independent optimal play."
  Stands with 6♥ 2♦ Q♦ (18)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 19 against a dealer's King, I have a strong hand. The odds of improving by hitting are very low (only an Ace or 2 helps), while the risk of busting is high. Standing is the optimal play here."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a soft 14 against a dealer's 8, as 14 is a weak total to stand on and the dealer is not in a vulnerable position to justify doubling."
  Drew J♣ -> A♦ 3♦ J♣ (14)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 14 against a dealer's 8, basic strategy dictates hitting as standing is statistically likely to lose against the dealer's probable made hand."
  Drew 5♠ -> A♦ 3♦ J♣ 5♠ (19)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 against a dealer's 8, the mathematical play is to stand; 19 is a strong total and hitting carries an extremely high risk of busting."
  Stands with A♦ 3♦ J♣ 5♠ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20 versus dealer 8, standing is optimal since hitting risks busting and doubling only adds variance for minimal improvement. Other players’ hands don’t justify deviating from basic strategy here."
  Stands with 10♣ Q♠ (20)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 16 (A5) against dealer 8 is a standard basic strategy hit, as standing loses to the dealer's likely 17-21 while hitting offers improvement potential without bust risk from ace. Doubling is inappropriate for this weak soft hand versus a strong dealer upcard."
  Drew 6♦ -> 5♥ A♠ 6♦ (12)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 12 against dealer 8 requires a hit per basic strategy, as standing loses to dealer's probable 18-21 while hitting improves the hand without high bust risk. Other players' strong hands (19, 20) don't alter this fundamental play."

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 20 is a strong pat hand against dealer 8; basic strategy mandates standing to avoid bust risk while favored against dealer's likely 17-21. Other players' hands do not influence this optimal play."
  Stands with 5♥ A♠ 6♦ 8♣ (20)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 12 against dealer's 8, basic strategy says to hit. The dealer has a strong up card and is likely to make a hand of 18+, so I need to improve my 12 despite the bust risk."

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no edge information (count/pen/rules), the optimal move is to minimize variance and preserve bankroll by flat-betting the table minimum. Staying aligned with the other $5 bettor keeps risk low while we wait for better conditions."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $75 bankroll, betting the $5 minimum preserves capital for long-term play and aligns with conservative bankroll management (6-7% risk per hand). Matching other players' low bets allows observation of table dynamics without unnecessary exposure."

  Reasoning: "With a hard 13 against a dealer's 7, basic strategy dictates hitting because the dealer is likely to reach a higher total, and 13 is insufficient to win."

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I’m slightly behind the chip leader but still ahead of two players, so there’s no need to take big variance early. A $10 bet keeps risk controlled while still allowing steady gain if the deck runs favorable."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With $80 balance, a $10 bet matches GPT-5.2 Pro's moderate aggression while staying conservative against higher-balance players like Gemini, preserving bankroll for sustained play."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table, I need to be strategic but not overly conservative. A $10 bet matches the middle-ground approach of other players while preserving enough bankroll for 4-5 more hands if I lose."

  Stands with Q♣ K♠ (20)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 12 vs a dealer Ace, standing is too weak and you need to improve; basic strategy is to hit. Doubling isn’t appropriate because 12 has poor equity against an Ace and you only get one card."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "As the current chip leader with a narrow margin, betting the minimum minimizes variance and forces opponents to take the risks necessary to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no edge information (count/penetration), the optimal long-run play is to minimize variance and preserve bankroll, so I’ll stick to the table minimum. I’m only $10 behind the chip leader, so there’s no need to take extra risk yet."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Starting with the table minimum bet matches the conservative plays of other players, preserves my $90 bankroll for better opportunities later, and allows assessment of the table dynamics and shoe."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table ($46 vs opponents' $90-$123), I need to play conservatively to stay in the game. Minimum betting preserves my bankroll and allows me to survive variance while waiting for favorable opportunities."

Grok 4.1 Fast: 3♠ 4♥ (7)
Opus 4.5: 2♠ 2♣ (4)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hard 11 against a dealer's 10, basic strategy dictates doubling down to maximize potential profit, as there is a high probability of drawing a 10-value card for a total of 21."
  Doubled down, drew 5♥ -> 3♦ 8♣ 5♥ (16) (Bet: $10)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 12 against a dealer 10, basic strategy is to hit because standing is a long-term losing spot and you can improve without busting too often. Other players’ hands don’t justify deviating here."
  Drew 3♣ -> 4♠ 8♥ 3♣ (15)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 15 against a dealer 10, basic strategy is to hit since standing has a worse expected value. The other players’ small cards shown aren’t enough information to justify deviating from the standard play."
  Drew K♦ -> 4♠ 8♥ 3♣ K♦ (BUST 25)
  GPT-5.2 Pro BUSTS!
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 7 vs dealer 10 requires hitting per basic strategy, as standing loses almost always and doubling is not viable with such a low total."
  Drew Q♠ -> 3♠ 4♥ Q♠ (17)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 17 vs dealer 10-value (K) requires standing per basic strategy, as hitting busts ~77% of the time while standing gives a fair chance against dealer's likely strong hand."
  Stands with 3♠ 4♥ Q♠ (17)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 4 against a dealer's King, I must hit - there's no risk of busting and I need to improve significantly. Standing on 4 would be an automatic loss, and doubling down on such a weak hand against a strong dealer upcard is too risky."
  Drew 6♠ -> 2♠ 2♣ 6♠ (10)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 10 against a dealer's King, I must hit since I cannot bust and need to improve significantly. The dealer likely has a strong hand with that King showing, so I need to build toward 17+ to have any chance of winning."
  Drew A♦ -> 2♠ 2♣ 6♠ A♦ (21 soft)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have 21, the best possible hand value without busting. There is absolutely no reason to hit - any card would either keep me at 21 (with the soft ace converting) or bust me with a 10-value card."
  Stands with 2♠ 2♣ 6♠ A♦ (21 soft)

=== New Round #65 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "As the current chip leader with a narrow $5 lead over GPT-5.2 Pro, betting the minimum minimizes variance and forces opponents to over-bet to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no information about deck composition or advantage, I’ll stick to the minimum to reduce variance and protect my bankroll. Being close to the other stacks doesn’t justify increasing risk without an edge."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Other players are betting the minimum $5, indicating a conservative table dynamic, so matching this preserves my $85 bankroll for long-term play while minimizing risk early on. As a professional, I prioritize bankroll management over aggressive bets with a modest stack."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table ($51 vs others' $85-$113), I need to play conservatively to stay in the game. Minimum bets preserve my bankroll while waiting for favorable situations to make strategic moves."

Opus 4.5: A♣ 10♥ (Blackjack)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 16 against a dealer's 10 and surrender unavailable, basic strategy dictates hitting because standing is statistically a guaranteed loss if the dealer has a high hole card."
  Drew 3♦ -> Q♥ 6♣ 3♦ (19)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 against a dealer's 10, standing is the correct strategic move as 19 is a strong hand and the risk of busting on a hit is extremely high."
  Stands with Q♥ 6♣ 3♦ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 12 vs a dealer 10, basic strategy is to hit because standing is a losing spot against a strong upcard and doubling isn’t viable on 12."
  Drew K♣ -> 2♦ 10♦ K♣ (BUST 22)
  GPT-5.2 Pro BUSTS!
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 7 against dealer's 10 is a clear hit per basic strategy, as standing loses to dealer's probable strong hand (17+), and doubling down is unsuitable for this weak total. Other players' outcomes do not influence independent optimal play."
  Drew 5♣ -> 2♠ 5♠ 5♣ (12)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 12 against dealer's 10 is a standard hit per basic strategy, as standing loses to the dealer's probable 17+ hand, while hitting offers a chance to improve with low bust risk. Other players' outcomes are irrelevant to independent optimal decisions."
  Drew 9♠ -> 2♠ 5♠ 5♣ 9♠ (21)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 21 against dealer's 10 is an automatic stand per basic strategy, as it's nearly unbeatable and hitting risks busting for no gain. Other players' hands do not affect this optimal independent decision."
  Stands with 2♠ 5♠ 5♣ 9♠ (21)

  Reasoning: "As the current chip leader, I am betting the minimum to minimize variance and force trailing opponents to take risks to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I’m slightly behind the chip leader, so I’ll keep variance low with the minimum bet to preserve bankroll flexibility and avoid unnecessary risk early."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "As a professional player starting with $90, I bet the minimum $5 to preserve bankroll, match the conservative bets of other players, and gather information on the shoe before increasing risk."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table ($58 vs others' $90-118), I need to play conservatively to stay in the game. Minimum betting preserves my bankroll and allows me to wait for better opportunities while the chip leaders take risks."

Opus 4.5: A♣ 9♥ (20 soft)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "According to basic strategy, a hard 13 against a dealer's 7 requires a hit, as the dealer has a strong probability of making a pat hand."
  Drew Q♠ -> 9♣ 4♥ Q♠ (BUST 23)
  Gemini 3 Pro BUSTS!
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 9 against a dealer 7, doubling isn’t profitable (double 9 is mainly vs 3–6), so the correct play is to hit and try to improve."
  Drew 10♣ -> 4♣ 5♦ 10♣ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 versus dealer 7, standing is optimal since hitting risks busting with minimal upside. Other players’ strong totals don’t change correct basic strategy here."
  Stands with 4♣ 5♦ 10♣ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on hard 18 against dealer 7, as the dealer has a strong upcard and 18 is sufficient to compete without risking a bust. Doubling is not viable for this hand strength."
  Stands with 8♦ Q♣ (18)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a soft 20, I have an excellent hand that beats the dealer's likely outcomes against a 7 up card. Hitting or doubling would be foolish as any card except an Ace would either keep me at 20 or potentially weaken my hand."

  Reasoning: "As the current chip leader with a slim margin, betting the minimum minimizes variance and forces trailing opponents to take risks to catch up."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no information about the shoe or any advantage, I’ll keep variance low and bet the minimum. I’m close enough to the current leader that there’s no need to take extra risk yet."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Starting with the minimum $5 bet conserves my $90 bankroll for sustained play (18 units), matching the low-risk approach of other players who are also betting small relative to their balances."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table ($63 vs others' $90-$113), I need to play conservatively to stay in the game. Minimum bets preserve my bankroll while waiting for favorable situations to make larger moves."

  Drew J♦ -> 7♦ 6♣ J♦ (BUST 23)
  Gemini 3 Pro BUSTS!
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20 you should always stand; hitting risks busting and doubling gives no meaningful upside against a dealer 8."
  Stands with J♦ K♠ (20)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 8 against dealer 8 requires hitting per basic strategy to improve without risking bust immediately. Doubling is suboptimal on low totals; other players' hands (one bust, strong 20 likely standing, weak 14) do not alter this."
  Drew J♥ -> 4♦ 4♣ J♥ (18)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 vs dealer 8 is a clear stand per basic strategy, as hitting risks busting (over 50% chance of 21+ with next card) with minimal improvement potential. Other players' hands (one bust, strong 20 standing, weak 14 likely hitting) do not alter independent optimal play."
  Stands with 4♦ 4♣ J♥ (18)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 14 against a dealer's 8, basic strategy dictates hitting since the dealer has a strong up card with good chances of making 18. Standing on 14 would likely lose to a dealer's probable 18, so I need to improve my hand despite the bust risk."

  Reasoning: "Betting the minimum preserves capital to protect my second-place position against Grok while minimizing variance early in the session."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I have a slight lead over the closest stack ($113 vs $108), so I’ll minimize variance and protect my position with the table minimum. With others yet to bet, keeping risk low is the best strategic default."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20, I have an extremely strong hand that should never be messed with, regardless of the dealer's Ace."
  Stands with 10♦ 10♣ (20)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 12 vs a dealer Ace is a clear hit since standing is a high-loss spot against a strong upcard. Doubling isn’t appropriate because your hand is too weak and you only get one card."
  Drew 2♣ -> K♥ 2♠ 2♣ (14)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 14 vs a dealer Ace is a hit in basic strategy because standing is a very low-equity spot against a strong upcard. You need to improve toward 17+ to have any reasonable chance."
  Drew 5♥ -> K♥ 2♠ 2♣ 5♥ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 19 is already a strong total; hitting risks busting and only marginally improves outcomes even against a dealer Ace. Basic strategy is to stand on 19."
  Stands with K♥ 2♠ 2♣ 5♥ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 10 against dealer's Ace is a standard hit per basic strategy, as standing risks dealer making 17+ easily and doubling is suboptimal with ace up due to high bust potential on next card."
  Drew 8♦ -> 7♦ 3♦ 8♦ (18)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 against dealer's Ace is a standard stand per basic strategy, as hitting risks busting (over 50% chance with 4-10 or face) while dealer must hit soft 17+ but standing maximizes equity on stiff hands."
  Stands with 7♦ 3♦ 8♦ (18)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 13 against a dealer's Ace, the dealer has a strong chance of making a good hand. Basic strategy dictates hitting on 13 vs Ace since standing on a stiff hand against an Ace is statistically worse than risking a bust."
  Drew A♦ -> 5♠ 8♥ A♦ (14)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 14 against a dealer's Ace, I'm in a tough spot but basic strategy still calls for hitting. The dealer's Ace gives them strong potential for 17-21, so standing on 14 is statistically worse than the risk of busting."
  Drew 3♦ -> 5♠ 8♥ A♦ 3♦ (17)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 17 against a dealer's Ace, basic strategy calls for standing. While 17 is weak, hitting risks busting, and the expected value of standing on 17 is better than hitting despite the dealer's strong up card."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I am trailing the leader by only $5; a $10 bet allows me to take the lead with a win while keeping my balance safe above the third-place player."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a small $118 bankroll and no advantage information, I’ll keep variance low and preserve capital by betting the table minimum. Other players’ bet sizes don’t affect my EV in a standard cash game."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With a $95 balance, a $10 bet matches the table's average ($5-10) from other players, balancing aggression with bankroll management at roughly 10% risk. This positions me competitively without overexposing early."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I'm significantly behind the other players with the lowest balance at the table, so I need to take moderate risk to catch up. Betting $10 matches the more aggressive players while preserving enough bankroll for multiple hands if I lose."

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand

  Stands with J♠ K♠ (20)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20 you should always stand; hitting risks busting and only improves on an Ace. Dealer showing 10 is strong, but 20 already beats most dealer outcomes."

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting soft 17 against dealer's 10-value card, as standing wins only ~28% of the time and hitting allows improvement with low bust risk. Other players' strong hands (18,20,soft 18) do not influence this independent decision."

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 18 against dealer 8, basic strategy mandates standing, as hitting risks busting (over 50% chance with a 10-value card likely) while the dealer has only about 38% chance to beat 18 from an 8 upcard. Other players' hands do not influence this decision."

  Reasoning: "With a soft 19 against a dealer's weak 6, doubling down maximizes expected value effectively leveraging the dealer's high probability of busting. Even if I draw a low card, the dealer's vulnerability makes this an aggressive but statistically favorable play."
  Doubled down, drew 3♠ -> A♦ 8♣ 3♠ (12) (Bet: $20)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 18 against a dealer 6, standing is optimal because the dealer is in a bust-prone spot and hitting risks turning a strong hand into a weaker one. Doubling is not appropriate with 18."
  Stands with K♥ 8♦ (18)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 20 is an extremely strong hand against any dealer upcard, especially a weak 6, which has a high bust probability; basic strategy dictates standing to avoid risking busting on a hit."
  Stands with J♥ K♦ (20)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows 6, which is a bust card - they must hit and have a high probability of busting. With my 12, I should stand and let the dealer take the risk of busting rather than risk busting myself."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $10
  Reasoning: "A conservative two-unit bet protects my second-place stack against the trailing players while retaining enough capital to double down or split if favorable cards are dealt."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no information about a player edge (e.g., a favorable count), the optimal long-run approach is to flat-bet the minimum to preserve bankroll. I’m already the table leader, so there’s no need to take extra variance to protect position."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With a $65 balance, betting $10 aligns with the table's average ($5-$10) for a balanced risk, preserving bankroll for multiple hands while showing moderate confidence. This conservative approach prioritizes longevity over aggressive play early on."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With $45 remaining and a $5 minimum, I'll bet $10 to stay competitive with the table average while preserving enough bankroll for 3-4 more hands if I lose. This keeps me in the game without overexposing on a single hand."

  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 against a dealer's 7, the hand is very strong; hitting carries a high risk of busting, so standing is the optimal strategy."
  Stands with 9♠ Q♥ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 13 vs a dealer 7, standing is too weak against the dealer’s likely strong totals, so basic strategy is to hit to try to improve toward 17+."
  Drew 7♣ -> 8♠ 5♣ 7♣ (20)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20, you should stand against any dealer upcard since hitting risks busting and only improves to 21 with an ace. The other players’ hands don’t justify deviating from basic strategy here."
  Stands with 8♠ 5♣ 7♣ (20)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 7 against dealer's 7 requires hitting per basic strategy, as standing loses to dealer's probable 17-21 while doubling down on such a low total has poor EV. Other players' strong hands do not influence this independent decision."
  Drew J♥ -> 4♥ 3♦ J♥ (17)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 17 against dealer's 7 is a standard stand per basic strategy, as hitting risks busting (5+ cards) with low EV gain against dealer's probable 17-21. Other players' strong hands (19-20) do not influence this independent decision."

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no edge information (count/rules/penetration), the optimal bankroll-preserving approach is a minimum flat bet. I’m ahead of the table, so there’s no need to increase variance right now."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no information about deck composition or a positive edge, I’ll keep variance low and preserve my slight lead by betting the table minimum. I can scale up later if conditions improve or others start pressing."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With $72 balance, a $10 bet is 14% of bankroll, a moderate risk matching Gemini's aggressive play while staying below higher-balance players' exposure; this positions me competitively early without overcommitting before observing dealer and table trends."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With a below-average stack of $55 compared to the table average around $80, I need to be somewhat aggressive to catch up but not reckless. A $10 bet matches the median table bet and gives me room to recover from losses while still making meaningful progress."

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 14 against a dealer's Queen (likely 20), I must hit despite the bust risk. Standing on 14 vs a 10-value card has very poor odds, and I need to improve my hand even though several low cards have been removed from play."

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: DoubleDown

Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit

Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5

  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting on hard 13 against dealer's 10, as the dealer has a strong upcard and is likely to make 17+. Standing risks losing to the dealer's probable pat hand, while doubling is inappropriate for this stiff total."
  Drew 4♣ -> 3♥ Q♦ 4♣ (17)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy mandates standing on hard 17 against any dealer upcard, including 10-value cards, as hitting risks busting with a 60%+ chance on the next card while standing preserves the hand against the dealer's likely strong total."
  Stands with 3♥ Q♦ 4♣ (17)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 19 against a dealer's Jack, I have a strong hand. Basic strategy dictates standing on 19 since the risk of busting far outweighs any potential gain from hitting."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I am currently in 3rd place with a small stack; betting the minimum preserves capital to stay ahead of Opus 4.5 while waiting for the leaders to falter."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "In a cash game, other players’ stacks don’t affect optimal betting, so I’ll keep variance low and preserve bankroll with a minimum flat bet. With only $73, a 1-unit bet maintains longevity and flexibility for future hands."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $57 bankroll, betting the $5 minimum preserves capital for more hands and follows conservative bankroll management (about 9% risk per hand). This matches the other players' bets, maintaining table dynamics without unnecessary risk early on."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table ($45 vs others' $48-73), I need to play conservatively to stay in the game. Minimum betting preserves my bankroll and allows me to weather losing streaks while waiting for favorable situations."

  Gemini 3 Pro BUSTS!
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 13 against a dealer 10, standing is a long-term losing spot, so basic strategy is to hit and try to improve while the dealer has a strong upcard. Doubling isn’t appropriate with 13."
  Drew 5♦ -> Q♦ 3♥ 5♦ (18)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 18 against a dealer 10, basic strategy is to stand because hitting risks busting frequently and the gain from improving is too small. Other players’ hands don’t change the optimal play in standard blackjack."
  Stands with Q♦ 3♥ 5♦ (18)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting soft 15 against dealer's 10, as it's vulnerable to dealer strong hands while doubling offers poor EV and standing risks busting the dealer too early. Other players' hands (one bust, stiff hands) suggest dealer likely strong but don't alter core strategy."
  Drew Q♠ -> 4♠ A♣ Q♠ (15)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 15 against dealer's 10 requires hitting per basic strategy, as standing loses to dealer's likely 17-21 while hitting offers a chance to improve without immediate bust risk. Other players' stiff hands (18, 14) and one bust don't change the fundamental EV-maximizing play."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a limited bankroll, betting the minimum preserves capital for essential strategic moves like doubling down or splitting while maintaining a slight lead over the last-place player."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I have the table lead ($68 vs $52 max), so I’ll bet the minimum to preserve my advantage and reduce variance without any count/edge information."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $52 balance, betting the $5 minimum preserves bankroll for multiple hands and matches the conservative bets of other players. This low-risk approach allows for strategic play without early elimination."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table ($40 vs others' $43-68), I need to play conservatively to stay in the game. A minimum bet preserves my bankroll while I wait for better opportunities to catch up."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Holding a hard 10 against a dealer's weak 2 is a statistically advantageous position; doubling down maximizes expected value as I am likely to draw a high card for a strong total while the dealer is vulnerable."
  Doubled down, drew 7♦ -> 5♦ 5♠ 7♦ (17) (Bet: $10)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20 you should always stand; hitting risks busting and doubling for one card offers no meaningful upside versus a weak dealer 2 upcard."
  Stands with K♠ 10♥ (20)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy requires hitting on hard 12 against a dealer's 2, as the dealer has a weak upcard but high potential to improve to 17+. Other players' hands (17, 20, 16) do not influence this independent decision."
  Drew 6♥ -> 2♥ Q♠ 6♥ (18)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy requires standing on hard 18 against a dealer's 2, as it's a strong hand with low risk of busting on hit and the dealer must draw to 17+. Other players' hands (17, 20, 16) do not influence independent decisions."
  Stands with 2♥ Q♠ 6♥ (18)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 16 against a dealer's 2, basic strategy suggests standing since the dealer has a higher chance of busting when starting with a low card. Hitting risks busting with any card 6 or higher, and the other players' strong hands don't change my individual odds."

=== New Round #90 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $10
  Reasoning: "As the short stack, betting roughly 30% of my balance allows me to close the gap on Opus 4.5 while retaining enough chips ($23) to fund a crucial double down or split."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no information about the count or edge this hand, the best risk-managed play is to bet the table minimum and preserve bankroll. I’m already the chip leader at the table, so there’s no need to increase variance to stay ahead."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a low balance of $47, betting the minimum $5 (about 10% of bankroll) follows conservative bankroll management to maximize hands played and minimize bust risk. Other players show varied aggression, but prioritizing survival over matching them is strategically sound."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With $35 balance, a $10 bet matches Gemini's aggression while preserving enough capital for 2-3 more hands if I lose. I'm in the weakest position at the table, so I need moderate risk to catch up without busting out."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 12 against a dealer showing a 10 (Jack), basic strategy dictates hitting because the dealer has a strong potential to beat 12, and the risk of busting is outweighed by the need to improve the hand."
  Drew 5♠ -> 8♦ 4♠ 5♠ (17)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand

GPT-5.2 Pro has Blackjack.
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 7 against dealer's 10 is a clear hit per basic strategy, as standing busts against dealer's likely 17-21 total. Doubling is inappropriate for such a weak hand."
  Drew A♣ -> 3♣ 4♥ A♣ (18 soft)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 18 (A,7) against dealer's 10 is a hit per basic strategy, as standing is weak against dealer's strong upcard and likely pat hand, while hitting allows improvement to 19+ without immediate bust risk."
  Drew Q♥ -> 3♣ 4♥ A♣ Q♥ (18)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Now holding hard 18 (A,3,4,10 with Ace as 1) against dealer's 10, basic strategy dictates standing, as hitting risks busting over 50% of the time while standing preserves a strong total against the dealer's likely 17-21."
  Stands with 3♣ 4♥ A♣ Q♥ (18)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit

=== New Round #91 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I’m already the bankroll leader, so I’ll minimize variance and protect my stack by betting the table minimum. Without any advantage information (e.g., a positive count), there’s no reason to scale up risk."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a low balance of $47, betting the minimum $5 preserves bankroll for more hands and manages risk effectively. Matching other players' conservative $5 bets aligns with table dynamics without overexposing my stack."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand

GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5

  GPT-5.2 Pro BUSTS!
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Hard 11 vs dealer 7 is a prime doubling spot per basic strategy, as the dealer has a high chance of busting while I have strong potential to improve to 21. Other players' strong hands don't alter this independent decision."
  Doubled down, drew J♦ -> 2♣ 9♣ J♦ (21) (Bet: $20)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 20 against a dealer's 7, standing is the optimal play. 20 is an excellent hand that wins against most dealer outcomes, and hitting would risk busting with virtually no benefit."
  Stands with J♠ Q♦ (20)

=== New Round #96 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a short stack of roughly 12 units, I am betting the minimum to preserve capital while maintaining my position ahead of Opus 4.5."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no information about deck composition or an advantage, optimal bankroll strategy is to flat-bet the table minimum. This preserves capital and keeps variance low while still staying competitive against smaller stacks."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With $87 balance, betting the $5 minimum is conservative bankroll management (5.7% risk per hand), matching other players' small bets to preserve capital for more hands and assess table dynamics early."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table ($57 vs others' $63-$100), I should play conservatively with minimum bets to preserve my bankroll and wait for better opportunities rather than risk falling further behind."
Dealer shows: 10♠ ??
Gemini 3 Pro: K♣ 5♥ (15)

Grok 4.1 Fast: 2♦ 7♣ (9)
Opus 4.5: 6♥ J♠ (16)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 15 against a dealer's strong 10 up card, basic strategy dictates hitting to improve the hand, as standing will likely result in a loss."
  Drew 4♠ -> K♣ 5♥ 4♠ (19)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19, the risk of busting is extremely high, and this is a strong total that stands a good chance of winning or pushing against the dealer's 10."
  Stands with K♣ 5♥ 4♠ (19)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 19 vs a dealer 10 is already a strong made hand; hitting risks busting and doubling down has negative expectation here. Stand and let the dealer try to beat 19."
  Stands with 9♣ Q♥ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 9 against dealer 10 requires hitting per basic strategy, as standing loses most often to dealer's likely 17-21. Doubling is suboptimal with this low total and strong dealer upcard; other players' hands do not influence the independent decision."
  Drew J♥ -> 2♦ 7♣ J♥ (19)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 19 against dealer 10 requires standing per basic strategy, as hitting risks busting (drawing 3+ busts 81% of the time) while 19 wins or pushes often enough against dealer's likely stiff hands. Other players' hands do not influence this independent decision."
  Stands with 2♦ 7♣ J♥ (19)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 16 against a dealer's 10, basic strategy dictates hitting since the dealer has a strong chance of making 17-21. Standing on 16 versus a 10 loses more often than hitting, despite the risk of busting."
  Drew Q♦ -> 6♥ J♠ Q♦ (BUST 26)

=== New Round #97 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a mid-tier stack, betting the minimum preserves capital to survive volatility while waiting for the chip leaders to falter."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no count/edge information, I’ll keep variance low and preserve my bankroll by betting the table minimum. I also already have the largest stack, so there’s no need to take extra risk early."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a $87 balance, matching the $5 minimum bet of other players allows conservative bankroll management and table observation without excessive risk early on. This positions me strategically against conservative bets from Gemini and GPT-5.2 while Opus decides."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table ($52 vs others' $63-$100), I need to play conservatively to stay in the game. Minimum bet preserves my bankroll while I wait for better opportunities to catch up."

Grok 4.1 Fast: A♥ 8♥ (19 soft)
Opus 4.5: A♦ 3♠ (14 soft)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 10 against a dealer's 10, as doubling is too risky given the dealer's strong potential for a 20."
  Drew 3♠ -> 4♠ 6♦ 3♠ (13)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Against a dealer showing a 10, a hard 13 is a weak hand that requires aggressive play; basic strategy dictates hitting to try and improve the total."
  Drew 9♦ -> 4♠ 6♦ 3♠ 9♦ (BUST 22)
  Gemini 3 Pro BUSTS!
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 16 vs a dealer 10 is a hit in basic strategy since standing loses too often against a likely strong dealer hand. Doubling isn’t appropriate here, so take a card and try to improve."
  Drew K♣ -> 9♦ 7♦ K♣ (BUST 26)
  GPT-5.2 Pro BUSTS!
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Soft 19 is a strong hand against dealer's 10; basic strategy dictates standing to avoid risking a bust on hit or unfavorable double down odds."
  Stands with A♥ 8♥ (19 soft)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With soft 14 against a dealer's 10-value card, I need to improve my hand. The soft hand gives me flexibility since I can't bust with one hit, and standing on 14 against a strong dealer upcard is too risky. Doubling would be too aggressive here - basic strategy calls for hitting soft 14 against a 10."
  Drew 3♣ -> A♦ 3♠ 3♣ (17 soft)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With soft 17 against a dealer's 10-value card, basic strategy dictates hitting since I cannot bust and need to improve my hand. Standing on soft 17 against a strong dealer upcard gives poor expected value, and hitting gives me a chance to reach 18-21."
  Drew 4♦ -> A♦ 3♠ 3♣ 4♦ (21 soft)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have 21, the best possible hand value without busting. There is absolutely no reason to hit when I already have the maximum winning hand."
  Stands with A♦ 3♠ 3♣ 4♦ (21 soft)

=== New Round #98 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Trailing the leaders significantly, I need to increase variance slightly above the minimum to catch up, while reserving enough bankroll to split or double down."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With no count/edge information, the best strategic move is to minimize variance and protect bankroll by betting the table minimum. My stack is already the largest at the table, so there’s no need to take extra risk to ‘catch up’ to anyone."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With $82 balance, a $10 bet (12% of bankroll) matches Gemini's moderate aggression while staying conservative relative to min bet constraints and GPT's low bet, preserving capital for multi-hand strategy amid varied table dynamics."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With $47 remaining and needing to compete against players with larger stacks, I'll bet $10 to match the more aggressive players while preserving enough bankroll for multiple hands if I lose."

Grok 4.1 Fast: J♣ 5♣ (15)
Opus 4.5: A♠ 2♥ (13 soft)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 15 against a dealer's 3, basic strategy dictates a hit as the dealer is not weak enough to justify a double down (usually reserved for dealer 4-6), and standing on 15 is not viable."
  Drew K♠ -> A♣ 4♥ K♠ (15)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 15 against a dealer's 3, basic strategy dictates standing because the risk of busting is high and the dealer is in a position where they are statistically likely to bust."
  Stands with A♣ 4♥ K♠ (15)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 17 is a strong standing hand; basic strategy stands on 17 against a dealer 3 since hitting is more likely to bust than improve your expectation."
  Stands with Q♣ 7♦ (17)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on hard 15 against dealer's 3, as the dealer busts approximately 40% of the time with a low upcard like 3. Other players' hands do not alter this independent optimal decision."
  Stands with J♣ 5♣ (15)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With soft 13 against a dealer's 3, basic strategy recommends hitting. While doubling down is sometimes suggested against dealer 3-6 with soft hands, my limited bankroll makes the safer hit play more prudent, and I can continue to improve this hand without risk of busting."
  Drew 7♣ -> A♠ 2♥ 7♣ (20 soft)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a soft 20, I have an excellent hand that beats most dealer outcomes. Standing is the clear optimal play - hitting would only risk turning a likely winner into a potential loser."

Opus 4.5: WIN! Wins $10 (New balance: $57)

=== New Round #99 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Trailling the leaders by over $20, I need to bet more than the minimum to close the gap, but betting $10 (approx 15% of bankroll) leaves room for splits and doubles without risking immediate ruin."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I’m currently the bankroll leader, so I’ll keep variance low and protect the lead by betting the table minimum until I have an edge signal (e.g., a favorable count or clear opportunity to press)."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With $92 balance, betting $10 (11%) matches Gemini's aggressive play while staying conservative relative to my bankroll and GPT's minimum, allowing observation of table dynamics without excessive risk."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With $57 against competitors averaging $87, I need moderate aggression to stay competitive. A $10 bet matches the table's common stake while preserving enough bankroll for 4-5 more hands if I lose."

Opus 4.5: 3♦ K♥ (13)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 15 against a dealer's weak 2 upcard, basic strategy dictates standing to avoid the high risk of busting, hoping the dealer will bust instead."
  Stands with Q♦ 5♥ (15)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 15 vs a dealer 2 is a standard stand because the dealer is in a weak bust range and hitting risks breaking your hand. Doubling isn’t appropriate with 15."
  Stands with 5♥ J♦ (15)
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 20 is an extremely strong hand that always stands in basic strategy against any dealer upcard, including a weak 2 where the dealer has high bust potential."
  Stands with K♦ Q♥ (20)
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 13 against a dealer's 2, basic strategy says to stand. The dealer must hit and has a reasonable chance of busting, while hitting my 13 risks busting with the many 10-value cards in the deck."

=== New Round #100 ===
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a mid-range stack significantly behind the leaders, the optimal strategy is to bet the minimum to minimize risk of ruin while preserving capital for essential splits and double downs."
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With no edge information, I’ll keep variance low and protect my $95 bankroll while staying active at the table. A $10 bet is modest relative to my stack and keeps me competitive versus the others without overexposing early."
Grok 4.1 Fast [x-ai/grok-4.1-fast] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With $102 balance, betting the $5 minimum adheres to conservative bankroll management (under 5% risk per hand), matching Gemini's low bet and preserving capital against unknown deck conditions."
Opus 4.5 [anthropic/claude-opus-4.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With the lowest balance at the table, I need to be somewhat aggressive to catch up to competitors while preserving enough bankroll for multiple hands. A $10 bet balances risk and potential reward without overcommitting my limited stack."

Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Since splitting is not an available option, I must hit this soft 12 against the dealer's King to improve the hand without any risk of busting."
  Drew 7♥ -> A♠ A♠ 7♥ (19 soft)
Gemini 3 Pro [google/gemini-3-pro-preview]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a Soft 19 against a Dealer's King, standing is the mathematically correct play as 19 is a strong total and hitting risks worsening the hand."
  Stands with A♠ A♠ 7♥ (19 soft)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 18 against a dealer 10, standing is usually too weak; you should hit to try to improve while the Ace protects you from busting. Doubling is only favorable for soft 18 vs weaker dealer upcards (typically 3–6), not vs 10."
  Drew 6♥ -> 7♠ A♦ 6♥ (14)
GPT-5.2 Pro [openai/gpt-5.2-pro]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Your Ace is now counted as 1, so this is a hard 14 vs a dealer 10, which is a clear hit in basic strategy. Standing leaves you too likely to lose to the dealer’s made hand."
