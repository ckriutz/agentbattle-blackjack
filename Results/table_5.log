=== New Round #1 ===
Trinity Mini [arcee-ai/trinity-mini] bets $25
  Reasoning: "Bet $25 to balance risk and potential reward while preserving capital. This moderate stake allows participation without excessive exposure, considering all players start with equal resources and the house edge."
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I bet $10 to balance moderate risk while observing other players' actions and potential table dynamics."
LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B [liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Low bet to stay in the game while minimizing risk; Trinity and Essential are competitive bets, but others are not yet active—bet small to avoid losing capital while assessing table dynamics."
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $20 as it's a balanced decision between taking a moderate risk and maintaining a stable position in the game. With a smaller bet, I aim to observe the other players' moves while still contributing to the pot."
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b] bets $20
  Reasoning: "Betting $20 positions me in the mid-range of current bets, balancing risk with potential reward while maintaining sufficient bankroll for future hands."

AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think: J♣ 2♥ (12)
Trinity Mini [arcee-ai/trinity-mini]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Dealer's weak up card (3) favors hitting to improve a stiff hand (12) before potential dealer bust."
  Drew K♣ -> 2♦ J♥ K♣ (BUST 22)
  Trinity Mini BUSTS!
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Already have strong 19; dealer's 3 is weak upcard. No need to risk busting with additional cards."
  Stands with 9♠ Q♥ (19)
LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B [liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer's 3♥ risks busting; my 16 is solid against busting dealer, and remaining hands suggest dealer has a strong starting hand. Standing avoids risk and preserves $40."
  Stands with 6♦ 10♠ (16)
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024]: Stand
  Reasoning: "My hand is a natural split of 6, which is a strong starting hand. The dealer's up card is a 3 of hearts, which is relatively weak, so standing should give me a good chance of winning without risk of busting."
  Stands with 3♠ 3♥ (6)
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 against dealer's 3, standing is optimal since the dealer has a high chance of busting and improving beyond 19 is unlikely."
  Stands with 9♣ 10♥ (19)
AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think [allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Dealer's 3 is weak; hitting to improve hand below 17 is statistically favorable despite bust risk."
  Drew 6♠ -> J♣ 2♥ 6♠ (18)
AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think [allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think]: Stand

=== New Round #2 ===
Trinity Mini [arcee-ai/trinity-mini] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Confident in current hand and aiming to engage without overextending resources."
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I'm betting $15 to stay within a moderate risk range, considering my balance and the minimum bet requirements of other players. This amount allows flexibility while maintaining strategic positioning."
LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B [liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I bet $10 to stay comfortably aggressive while minimizing risk, leveraging the table’s weak players and my $40 balance to extend my session without overexposure."
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I observe that the table has an active player (LiquidAI) and a dormant player (DeepCogito). I decide to take a moderate risk by doubling my bet to match LiquidAI's current bet. This allows me to potentially increase my chances of winning while maintaining a balanced approach."
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b] bets $15
  Reasoning: "Matching the middle-range bets at the table while maintaining a conservative bankroll management strategy with 4.7x the minimum bet."
AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think [allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think] bets $15

AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think: 3♦ 3♦ (6)
Trinity Mini [arcee-ai/trinity-mini]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Double down on a hard 11 against a dealer's 4. Dealer's low card increases bust probability, and doubling maximizes potential profit with favorable odds."
  Doubled down, drew K♦ -> 3♠ 8♣ K♦ (21) (Bet: $20)
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "The dealer's 4 is a weak up card, but my 16 is borderline. Trinity and DeepCogito have strong hands, but LiquidAI, Command, and AllenAI have weak hands, making it less likely they'll draw attention. Since the dealer has a low up card, I can afford to take a risk with a Hit instead of standing on 16."
  Drew K♠ -> 10♣ 6♠ K♠ (BUST 26)
  Essential RNJ-1 Instruct BUSTS!
LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B [liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows 4, hand value 7 is strong but below 21; DeepCogito holds a blackjack while others bust. Standing preserves $10 on solid foundation with minimal risk."
  Stands with 4♣ 3♣ (7)
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024]: Hit
  Reasoning: "My hand is strong, but the dealer's 4♥ is a low card, so I'll hit to see if I can get closer to 21 without busting."
  Drew 7♥ -> 4♦ Q♠ 7♥ (21)
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024]: Stand
  Reasoning: "My hand is now a natural blackjack, and the dealer's up card is a 4♥. I have a strong hand and it's unlikely that I'll improve without busting other players, so I'll stand pat."
  Stands with 4♦ Q♠ 7♥ (21)
DeepCogito V2.1-671B has Blackjack.
AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think [allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Low hand total of 6 requires hitting to increase chances of reaching a strong hand. Dealer's 4 upcard suggests they may need to draw multiple cards."
  Drew 8♠ -> 3♦ 3♦ 8♠ (14)
AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think [allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hand total 14 is below 17; hitting aims to reach a stronger hand against dealer's low upcard."

=== New Round #3 ===
Trinity Mini [arcee-ai/trinity-mini] bets $20
  Reasoning: "Betting $20 balances competitiveness with risk management, maintaining a substantial portion of my bankroll while signaling strength to opponents."
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I'm betting the minimum $5 to conserve my balance while monitoring the table. With $45 total and other players having varying balances, maintaining flexibility allows me to adjust strategy based on unfolding cards and other players' actions."
LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B [liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Low-risk bet to build momentum against tight players; balanced against deep pockets and active competitors without overcommitting."
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I'll match the highest bet made at the table to maintain a competitive edge. This is a strategic move to avoid giving any advantage to other players who might have a higher bet."
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b] bets $10
  Reasoning: "A $10 bet is conservative yet competitive, keeping me in the game while maintaining a healthy bankroll for future hands given the table's betting range of $5-20."

AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think: 3♠ 8♥ (11)
Trinity Mini [arcee-ai/trinity-mini]: Hit
  Reasoning: "13 is a weak hand requiring improvement; dealer's Q♠ suggests possible 20 but hitting offers chance to reach 17-20 without doubling down risk."
  Drew 5♦ -> Q♦ 3♣ 5♦ (18)
Trinity Mini [arcee-ai/trinity-mini]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Current hand totals 18, a strong position against dealer's Q♠ (likely 20). Standing avoids busting risk while capitalizing on dealer's likely strong hand."
  Stands with Q♦ 3♣ 5♦ (18)
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a strong 18 and the dealer showing a Queen, I have a good chance of winning. Standing avoids potential busts and leverages my strong position."
  Stands with A♥ 7♣ (18 soft)
LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B [liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 17, a hard 17 vs dealer's Q♠ (showing strong hand) and multiple high-value players (18s), standing risks losing to bust or dealer’s strong upcard. Hit improves to potentially make 19–20 and capitalize on dealer exposure."
  Drew J♦ -> 7♦ K♠ J♦ (BUST 27)
  LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B BUSTS!
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024]: Hit
  Reasoning: "I need to get closer to 21 without busting. The dealer's up card is a Queen, so I can expect a mix of high and low cards. I'll take a hit to see if I can reach a better hand without going over."
  Drew 5♠ -> 4♦ Q♣ 5♠ (19)
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024]: Hit
  Reasoning: "I have a soft 19, and the dealer's up card is a Queen, which is a favorable card to draw. I'll take another hit to try to reach a better hand without busting."
  Drew 3♥ -> 4♦ Q♣ 5♠ 3♥ (BUST 22)
  Command R7B BUSTS!
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on 18 is the statistically correct play against a dealer's 10, as the risk of busting is too high and the dealer has a good chance of having a strong hand."
  Stands with 10♦ 8♥ (18)
AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think [allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 11 should always hit to improve the hand, as busting is impossible on the next card and the dealer's strong upcard requires maximizing total."
  Drew A♠ -> 3♠ 8♥ A♠ (12)
AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think [allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 12 against dealer's Q requires hitting to improve hand; bust risk is low with only 10s causing it, while standing likely loses to dealer's strong upcard."
  Drew 6♥ -> 3♠ 8♥ A♠ 6♥ (18)
AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think [allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 is a strong hand against dealer's Q; hitting risks busting with any card 4 or higher, while standing avoids risk and leverages dealer's potential weak hand."

  Reasoning: "Bet maximum to capitalize on favorable table conditions and maximize potential winnings given my current balance."
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Betting $5 is a conservative approach given my $40 balance, minimizing risk while staying within the minimum bet requirement."
LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B [liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Playing $10 balances risk and position; Trinity is active but not aggressive, while others are cautious. A small bet limits downside while preserving bankroll and exploiting potential loose play."
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I want to make a moderate bet to observe the game flow and assess the others' strategies. Starting with a mid-range bet allows me to control risk and potentially gain insights into the table dynamics."
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b] bets $20
  Reasoning: "Betting $20 balances risk and potential reward, allowing for multiple hands while maintaining a healthy bankroll relative to the table's betting range."

DeepCogito V2.1-671B: K♦ Q♠ (20)
AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think: A♠ 2♥ (13 soft)
Trinity Mini [arcee-ai/trinity-mini]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 15 against a dealer's 10, hitting risks busting on a 10-value card draw. The dealer's strong upcard suggests a high probability of a 10 or 11 in the hole, making standing the safer play to avoid unnecessary risk."
  Stands with K♠ 5♣ (15)
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a total of 10 and the dealer showing a strong J♣, I have a favorable position to improve my hand without busting. Hitting gives me the best chance to reach a stronger total than the dealer."
  Drew 2♣ -> 6♠ 4♣ 2♣ (12)
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a total of 12 and the dealer showing a strong J♣, I have a moderate chance to improve my hand without busting. Hitting gives me a reasonable chance to reach a stronger total than the dealer while avoiding a definitive bust."
  Drew 5♥ -> 6♠ 4♣ 2♣ 5♥ (17)
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a total of 17, which is a strong hand, and facing a dealer's strong J♣, standing is the best choice to avoid potentially busting. The dealer's high up card makes hitting risky, as the likelihood of improving to a stronger hand without exceeding 21 is low."
  Stands with 6♠ 4♣ 2♣ 5♥ (17)
LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B [liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer’s J♣ hints at a weak up card, and the high-value hands visible (17–20) suggest aggressive play. With a soft 13, standing avoids risk and preserves $30 while guarding against a bust."
  Stands with 3♦ 5♥ (8)
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024]: Hit
  Reasoning: "The dealer's up card is a Jack of Clubs, which is a relatively strong card. My hand value is 20, which is strong but not strong enough to be a 'soft' hand. I will hit to see if I can improve my hand and potentially reach a higher value, especially since I have a low remaining balance and a small current bet."
  Drew 8♦ -> K♥ Q♦ 8♦ (BUST 28)
  Command R7B BUSTS!
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 20, I have a very strong hand that's likely to win against the dealer's potential hands. The dealer shows J which is favorable, but standing is statistically the best play to avoid busting."
  Stands with K♦ Q♠ (20)
AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think [allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 13 against dealer's 10 should hit to improve hand without bust risk, leveraging flexibility of soft total."
  Drew 8♥ -> A♠ 2♥ 8♥ (21 soft)
AllenAI Olmo 3.1-32B Think [allenai/olmo-3.1-32b-think]: Stand

LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B [liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b] bets $15
  Reasoning: "The table has a mix of cautious and aggressive players; betting $15 balances risk while positioning me competitively against lower-risk players without overcommitting."
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a low balance, I want to manage risk while still trying to win. Starting with the minimum bet is a cautious approach to gauge the situation and the other players' strategies."
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b] bets $15

Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Stand

  Stands with 9♣ J♠ (19)
LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B [liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows 6♣ (weak up card), and the field has strong hands like Essential RNJ-1 (19) and AllenAI Olmo (20). Holding 8 against this high risk favors standing to avoid busting while minimizing loss."
  Stands with 4♦ 4♣ (8)
Command R7B [cohere/command-r7b-12-2024]: Hit

LiquidAI LFM2 8B A1B [liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b] bets $10

Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Stand

DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 16 against dealer's 5, the statistically correct move is to stand since dealer has high bust potential and hitting risks busting."

=== New Round #18 ===
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I'm betting the minimum of $5 to conserve my bankroll while observing other players. With DeepCogito V2.1-671B still at the table, I want to see how they play before committing more funds."
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Betting the minimum to preserve bankroll while maintaining table position, as the Essential RNJ player's bet doesn't warrant a larger wager given our limited balance."
Dealer shows: 9♦ ??
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct: 6♠ K♥ (16)
DeepCogito V2.1-671B: 3♣ J♥ (13)
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "I have a 16 against a dealer 9, which is a weak hitting position. The dealer's 9 is a strong upcard that will make themself, and my 16 is likely to bust if I hit, but I'm also not in a strong enough position to stand confidently. I'll take another card to improve my hand."
  Drew A♦ -> 6♠ K♥ A♦ (17)
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I now have a solid 17 against the dealer's 9. Standing is the optimal play as I'm unlikely to improve my hand without busting, and 17 is a strong enough total to stand against a dealer's 9."
  Stands with 6♠ K♥ A♦ (17)
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 13 against dealer's 9, hitting is statistically favorable as there's significant room to improve without excessive bust risk."
  Drew 8♦ -> 3♣ J♥ 8♦ (21)
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 21, you have a guaranteed win unless the dealer also has 21 or achieves it through multiple draws, making standing the optimal play."

Essential RNJ-1 Instruct: 4♠ 7♦ (11)
DeepCogito V2.1-671B: J♦ K♥ (20)
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows Q♣ with strong up card. Hand value 11 is below 17 and should stand at 17+. No other players have favorable hands to influence strategy. Hit to improve hand before potential dealer strong total."
  Drew A♣ -> 4♠ 7♦ A♣ (12)
Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hand value remains 12, below the recommended 17+ to stand. Dealer's strong Q♣ up card makes hitting preferable to risk potential dealer bust. No other players' hands influence strategy significantly for this decision."
  Drew J♠ -> 4♠ 7♦ A♣ J♠ (BUST 22)
  Essential RNJ-1 Instruct BUSTS!
DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20, standing is the optimal play as the dealer has a Q showing, and the risk of busting by hitting far outweighs the minimal chance of improving the hand."

Essential RNJ-1 Instruct [essentialai/rnj-1-instruct]: Stand

DeepCogito V2.1-671B [deepcogito/cogito-v2.1-671b]: Hit
