Kimi K2.5 joins the game with balance: $50
DeepSeek V3.2 joins the game with balance: $50
Qwen 3 joins the game with balance: $50
zAI GLM joins the game with balance: $50

=== New Round #1 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Starting conservatively with the table minimum to assess opponents' strategies and preserve bankroll for optimal betting opportunities. This minimizes early variance while maintaining flexibility to escalate bets based on subsequent hand dynamics."
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Starting with the minimum bet to conserve my limited bankroll and assess the dealer's tendencies and table flow before increasing risk."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $5
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet the minimum $5 to preserve my balance while observing the table dynamics, especially since other players are also betting minimally and I have no strong hand information yet."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Starting with the table minimum to preserve bankroll and observe the card flow before increasing stakes."
Dealer shows: 5♣ ??
Kimi K2.5: 2♥ 2♠ (4)
DeepSeek V3.2: 5♥ 9♣ (14)
Qwen 3: K♦ 5♠ (15)
zAI GLM: 8♣ 9♠ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a pair of 2s (hard 4) against the dealer's weak 5, splitting would be ideal but isn't available; hitting is the correct basic strategy play to improve the hand while the dealer is likely to bust."
  Drew 4♦ -> 2♥ 2♠ 4♦ (8)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting hard 8 against a dealer 5 to improve toward a competitive total, as standing relies solely on the dealer busting (roughly 43% probability) whereas hitting yields positive expected value."
  Drew 5♦ -> 2♥ 2♠ 4♦ 5♦ (13)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on hard 13 against a dealer's weak 5, as the dealer has a high bust probability (~42%), whereas hitting risks a significant chance of busting with limited expected value gain."
  Stands with 2♥ 2♠ 4♦ 5♦ (13)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand value of 14 against a dealer 5, I should hit since the dealer has a high chance of busting, and standing on 14 is too weak."
  Drew 6♣ -> 5♥ 9♣ 6♣ (20)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a strong hand of 20, standing is optimal as the dealer's 5 up card gives them a high bust risk, and hitting would risk breaking a very favorable total."
  Stands with 5♥ 9♣ 6♣ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows 5, which is a weak up card, but my hand is 15, which is not ideal to hit against 5 due to bust risk. With other players holding 13, 17, and 20, and knowing the dealer is likely to bust, standing is safer and strategic."
  Stands with K♦ 5♠ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on hard 17 is the correct basic strategy play, especially since the dealer's weak upcard of 5 makes a dealer bust very likely."
  Stands with 8♣ 9♠ (17)

Dealer reveals: 5♣ 4♥ (9)
Dealer draws J♦ -> 5♣ 4♥ J♦ (19)
Dealer stands with 5♣ 4♥ J♦ (19)

DeepSeek V3.2: WIN! Wins $5 (New balance: $55)
Qwen 3: LOSE (New balance: $45)
zAI GLM: LOSE (New balance: $45)

=== New Round #2 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I'm $10 behind chip leader DeepSeek but tied with two others; betting $10 allows me to potentially close the gap to the leader while preserving 80% of my bankroll to withstand variance."
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting $10 matches Kimi's bet to maintain a competitive position while keeping risk moderate, preserving sufficient bankroll for future hands."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I bet $10 to match the current average bet at the table, maintaining a balanced position without overextending my $45 balance while staying competitive with other players."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Betting the minimum to preserve bankroll against the table's $10 standard, as my $45 balance requires conservative risk management."
Dealer shows: 8♣ ??
Kimi K2.5: 2♣ 6♠ (8)
DeepSeek V3.2: 8♥ 10♥ (18)
Qwen 3: 10♦ 9♣ (19)
zAI GLM: 8♦ 4♣ (12)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard total of 8 against the dealer's strong 8 upcard, basic strategy requires hitting to improve the hand rather than doubling or standing."
  Drew A♥ -> 2♣ 6♠ A♥ (19 soft)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a soft 19 against the dealer's 8, basic strategy mandates standing since 19 is a strong total with limited improvement potential from hitting, and the dealer must draw to beat me."
  Stands with 2♣ 6♠ A♥ (19 soft)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 18 against dealer's 8, standing is statistically optimal to avoid busting and let the dealer risk going over 21."
  Stands with 8♥ 10♥ (18)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19, I have a strong hand that is likely to beat the dealer's 8 upcard, which has a high probability of busting or ending up under 19. Standing preserves my advantage and avoids unnecessary risk."
  Stands with 10♦ 9♣ (19)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Standing on 12 against a dealer's 8 is mathematically disadvantageous as the dealer has a high probability of making a strong hand. I must hit to improve my total."
  Drew Q♣ -> 8♦ 4♣ Q♣ (BUST 22)
  zAI GLM BUSTS!

Dealer reveals: 8♣ J♣ (18)

DeepSeek V3.2: PUSH (New balance: $55)
Qwen 3: WIN! Wins $10 (New balance: $55)
zAI GLM: LOSE (New balance: $40)

=== New Round #3 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting 2 units allows me to build my stack while preserving bankroll for variance; with opponents holding similar balances, early aggression is unnecessary until card flow indicates positive expectation."
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2] bets $15
  Reasoning: "A moderate bet to build momentum while maintaining enough balance for multiple hands, especially with two players yet to bet and the table dynamics unknown."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $10 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a balanced approach without overcommitting. This allows me to stay competitive while preserving capital, especially since zAI GLM hasn't bet yet and DeepSeek V3.2 is betting higher, which may indicate aggression I should cautiously respond to."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting $10 represents 25% of my bankroll, matching the table's betting aggression without risking too much capital on a single hand."
Dealer shows: A♥ ??
Kimi K2.5: A♣ 4♠ (15 soft)
DeepSeek V3.2: 8♥ 5♣ (13)
Qwen 3: K♣ 8♠ (18)
zAI GLM: 9♣ A♠ (20 soft)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 15 against a dealer Ace requires aggressive improvement; hitting cannot bust me (Ace becomes 1 if needed) and offers better equity than standing or doubling against this strong upcard."
  Drew Q♦ -> A♣ 4♠ Q♦ (15)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 15 against a dealer Ace requires hitting when surrender is unavailable; standing wins only when the dealer busts (~16% chance), while hitting provides a ~46% probability to improve to 16-21, making it the only mathematically defensible play."
  Drew 8♥ -> A♣ 4♠ Q♦ 8♥ (BUST 23)
  Kimi K2.5 BUSTS!
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 13 against dealer's Ace, hitting is correct basic strategy to avoid a likely loss if dealer has a strong down card."
  Drew 7♣ -> 8♥ 5♣ 7♣ (20)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20, standing is optimal since it's already a very strong hand and hitting risks busting."
  Stands with 8♥ 5♣ 7♣ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 18 against the dealer's Ace, standing is the optimal play. The dealer has a high chance of making 17 or higher, and hitting risks busting, while standing minimizes risk with a strong hand."
  Stands with K♣ 8♠ (18)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Soft 20 is a premium hand; hitting risks turning it into a bustable hard 10 or 11, and doubling is unwise. Standing maximizes the chance of winning against the dealer's Ace."
  Stands with 9♣ A♠ (20 soft)

Dealer reveals: A♥ 7♥ (18 soft)
Dealer stands with A♥ 7♥ (18 soft)

=== Results ===
Kimi K2.5: LOSE (New balance: $45)
DeepSeek V3.2: WIN! Wins $15 (New balance: $70)
Qwen 3: PUSH (New balance: $55)
zAI GLM: WIN! Wins $10 (New balance: $50)

=== New Round #4 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "As the short stack at $45 versus opponents up to $70, I need to build chips aggressively but avoid busting. Betting $10 (22% of bankroll) doubles the minimum to gain ground on leaders while preserving enough for 3-4 more hands if I lose."
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I'm betting a moderate amount to balance risk with potential gain, staying above the minimum but not overexposing my $70 balance early."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I bet $10 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while managing risk, as my balance is moderate and I want to avoid overextending."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Betting the minimum preserves my limited bankroll against higher-stakes players, allowing me to apply basic strategy without significant risk of ruin."
Dealer shows: K♣ ??
Kimi K2.5: A♥ Q♥ (Blackjack)
DeepSeek V3.2: 5♠ J♠ (15)
Qwen 3: 10♣ 6♣ (16)
zAI GLM: 4♣ 9♥ (13)
Kimi K2.5 has Blackjack.
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With 15 against dealer's K, standing risks losing to likely strong dealer hand; hitting gives a chance to improve while doubling is too risky given the low starting total."
  Drew 6♣ -> 5♠ J♠ 6♣ (21)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have 21, the best possible hand, so standing guarantees a win unless the dealer also has blackjack, which is unlikely with a visible K."
  Stands with 5♠ J♠ 6♣ (21)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a 16 against the dealer's King, hitting carries significant risk of busting, especially since two other players already have 21 and the dealer is likely to stand. Standing minimizes loss potential in this high-risk scenario."
  Stands with 10♣ 6♣ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 13 against a dealer's 10, as the dealer is likely to finish with a high hand and standing offers a very low probability of winning."
  Drew J♠ -> 4♣ 9♥ J♠ (BUST 23)
  zAI GLM BUSTS!

Dealer reveals: K♣ 8♦ (18)
Dealer stands with K♣ 8♦ (18)

DeepSeek V3.2: WIN! Wins $15 (New balance: $85)
Qwen 3: LOSE (New balance: $45)
zAI GLM: LOSE (New balance: $45)

=== New Round #5 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With only 12x the minimum in my bankroll and DeepSeek holding a significant chip advantage, I need to preserve capital to survive variance and capitalize on positive counts rather than risking early elimination with oversized bets."
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2] bets $25
  Reasoning: "Betting $25 balances aggression with bankroll management, allowing for potential double downs while maintaining a reasonable risk level given my position and the table's betting dynamics."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $15 to stay competitive with the other players while managing risk, as my balance is modest and I want to avoid going all-in prematurely. This allows me to participate actively without overextending."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With a limited bankroll of $45, I am betting $10 to balance capital preservation with the potential for profit, avoiding the high-risk strategies employed by the other players."
Dealer shows: Q♥ ??
Kimi K2.5: A♦ 7♥ (18 soft)
DeepSeek V3.2: 3♦ 7♥ (10)
Qwen 3: 2♥ 5♥ (7)
zAI GLM: 10♦ Q♣ (20)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Soft 18 vs dealer 10 is a stand per basic strategy; hitting risks converting to a weaker hard total while the dealer likely has a strong hand."
  Stands with A♦ 7♥ (18 soft)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard total of 10 against a dealer Q, hitting is optimal to improve the hand, and doubling is risky given the low remaining balance."
  Drew 7♣ -> 3♦ 7♥ 7♣ (17)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 17 against a dealer Q, standing is correct as hitting risks busting and the dealer has a high chance of busting or making 17-21."
  Stands with 3♦ 7♥ 7♣ (17)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 7 against the dealer's Queen, hitting is the only viable option. Standing or doubling down would be extremely risky given the dealer's strong up card, and I need to improve my hand to avoid busting or losing to a likely dealer hand of 17 or higher."
  Drew 8♥ -> 2♥ 5♥ 8♥ (15)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 15 against the dealer's Queen, hitting is necessary to improve my position. The dealer is likely to have a strong hand (17+), and standing with 15 would be a high-risk play given the current table conditions and other players' strong hands."
  Drew Q♥ -> 2♥ 5♥ 8♥ Q♥ (BUST 25)
  Qwen 3 BUSTS!
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on 20 is the optimal play as hitting carries a high risk of busting and the dealer must beat a strong total of 20."

Dealer reveals: Q♥ 6♥ (16)
Dealer draws 2♠ -> Q♥ 6♥ 2♠ (18)

DeepSeek V3.2: LOSE (New balance: $60)
Qwen 3: LOSE (New balance: $30)
zAI GLM: WIN! Wins $10 (New balance: $55)

=== New Round #6 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting $10 preserves 6 betting units for variance while establishing a solid presence at the table; it's aggressive enough to build a stack against the dealer but conservative enough to outlast Qwen 3's likely desperation plays."
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2] bets $15
  Reasoning: "With a moderate bankroll of $60 and a minimum bet of $5, I'm betting $15 to establish a solid position and apply pressure, while leaving room for potential splits or doubles."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting $10 balances risk and opportunity, matching Kimi K2.5’s bet to stay competitive without overextending my $30 balance. It allows for strategic play while maintaining flexibility for future rounds."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a limited bankroll of $55, a conservative approach is best to minimize variance and stay in the game. Betting the minimum allows me to weather potential losing streaks while observing the table flow."
Dealer shows: 7♣ ??
Kimi K2.5: 7♦ 3♠ (10)
DeepSeek V3.2: J♦ 4♦ (14)
Qwen 3: A♦ A♥ (12 soft)
zAI GLM: Q♣ 2♥ (12)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hard 10 against dealer's 7, basic strategy dictates doubling down to maximize expected value, as I have strong odds to reach 20 while the dealer must hit to a minimum of 17."
  Doubled down, drew 10♥ -> 7♦ 3♠ 10♥ (20) (Bet: $20)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 14 against the dealer's 7, hitting is the statistically correct basic strategy play to improve the hand, as standing risks losing to a likely dealer 17 or higher."
  Drew 2♠ -> J♦ 4♦ 2♠ (16)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 16 against a dealer 7, basic strategy dictates hitting, as standing is likely a loss if the dealer makes a 17 or higher."
  Drew 6♣ -> J♦ 4♦ 2♠ 6♣ (BUST 22)
  DeepSeek V3.2 BUSTS!
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a soft 12 (A♦ A♥) against the dealer's 7♣, doubling down is optimal. The dealer has a high chance of making a strong hand (17+), but my soft hand gives me flexibility. Doubling maximizes expected value here, especially since other players are already showing strong or busted hands."
  Doubled down, drew J♥ -> A♦ A♥ J♥ (12) (Bet: $20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 12 against a dealer 7, as the dealer has a high probability of making a hand and I must improve my total to compete."
  Drew 3♦ -> Q♣ 2♥ 3♦ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy requires hitting a hard 15 against a dealer's 7, as standing gives the dealer a high probability of making a hand of 17 or better."

zAI GLM: LOSE (New balance: $50)

=== New Round #7 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With the chip lead and an $80 bankroll, betting $10 represents 12.5% of my stack—aggressive enough to build momentum against shorter stacks while preserving adequate bankroll for variance."
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2] bets $15
  Reasoning: "A $15 bet balances aggression with risk management, positioning me as a moderate player between Kimi's $10 and potential higher bets from the others."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I bet $10 to stay competitive with other players while managing risk, as my balance is moderate and I want to maintain flexibility for future hands."

Qwen 3: 7♥ K♦ (17)
zAI GLM: 3♦ 4♦ (7)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 12 against the dealer's 10, basic strategy requires hitting to improve the hand, as standing gives insufficient value to beat the dealer's likely strong total (20+)."
  Drew 9♣ -> 2♣ K♣ 9♣ (21)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a total of 21, hitting risks an immediate bust on any card value; standing maximizes expected value as 21 beats all dealer totals except blackjack push."
  Stands with 2♣ K♣ 9♣ (21)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 18 against a dealer's J, standing is statistically optimal as hitting risks busting and doubling is too risky with a hard total."
  Stands with K♣ 8♦ (18)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have 17, which is a strong hand, especially with the dealer showing a Jack (a strong up card). Given that two other players already have 18 and 21, I should avoid the risk of busting by hitting, and standing is the safest and most strategic choice."
  Stands with 7♥ K♦ (17)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a total of 7 against a dealer's 10, hitting is the only viable option to improve the hand, as standing guarantees a loss and doubling is too risky."
  Drew 6♠ -> 3♦ 4♦ 6♠ (13)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Standing on 13 against a dealer's 10 is statistically disadvantageous. I must hit to try and improve my hand, as the dealer is likely to finish with a strong total."

zAI GLM: LOSE (New balance: $45)

=== New Round #8 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Maintaining chip leadership with a measured $10 bet (~11% of bankroll) applies pressure on shorter stacks while preserving sufficient depth to weather variance."
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Matching the table's current bet size to blend in and manage risk while preserving capital for future hands."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $10 to stay competitive with other players while managing risk, as my balance is moderate and I want to maintain table presence without overextending."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Matching the table standard of $10 allows for consistent play without overexposing my bankroll relative to the minimum bet."

DeepSeek V3.2: 5♠ 9♥ (14)
Qwen 3: 5♥ 5♦ (10)
zAI GLM: 9♠ Q♠ (19)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Against a dealer 10, basic strategy requires hitting soft 18 to try improving to 19-21, as standing loses too frequently to the dealer's strong upcard."
  Drew 9♣ -> A♠ 7♥ 9♣ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standard basic strategy requires standing on hard 17 against a dealer 10; hitting carries an approximately 62% bust probability with only a 38% chance of improving to 18-21, making it mathematically inferior to standing and hoping the dealer busts or finishes with less than 17."
  Stands with A♠ 7♥ 9♣ (17)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 14 against the dealer's strong Q, hitting is necessary to improve the hand, as standing risks losing to likely dealer totals of 17 or higher."
  Drew 9♥ -> 5♠ 9♥ 9♥ (BUST 23)
  DeepSeek V3.2 BUSTS!
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 10 against the dealer's Queen, doubling down is optimal as I have a strong chance to reach 20 or 21 with one card, and the dealer is likely to bust or have a weak hand (Queen is a high card but I have a good chance to beat it with a 10 or face card)."
  Doubled down, drew J♣ -> 5♥ 5♦ J♣ (20) (Bet: $20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on hard 19 is the optimal play against a dealer's 10, as hitting carries a high bust risk and offers minimal upside."

zAI GLM: WIN! Wins $10 (New balance: $55)

=== New Round #9 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Opening with 10% of bankroll to establish a baseline while preserving flexibility for variance; having the largest stack allows steady pressure without risking early elimination."
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2] bets $10
  Reasoning: "A $10 bet balances risk and reward, matching Kimi's bet to stay competitive while keeping half my balance for future hands."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $10 to stay competitive with other players at the table while maintaining a conservative risk level given my $60 balance. This allows me to participate actively without exposing too much of my stack to potential losses."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 15 against the dealer's 10, hitting carries a high risk of busting. The dealer has a strong up card, but standing minimizes risk, especially with DeepSeek already holding a strong 20 and Kimi already busting."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit

  Drew 7♦ -> 3♥ 3♠ 7♦ (13)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 13 against the dealer's 10 upcard, basic strategy mandates hitting to improve toward 17-21, as standing on this weak total faces roughly 77% probability of losing against the dealer's likely strong final hand."

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 10 against the dealer's 10, doubling down is optimal as it maximizes potential gain when the dealer is likely to stand on a strong hand, and I have a good chance to improve to 20 or 21 with one card."
  Doubled down, drew A♦ -> 6♦ 4♣ A♦ (21 soft) (Bet: $20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit

=== New Round #12 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting $10 preserves 7 hands of runway while applying pressure to shorter stacks; conservative enough to outlast DeepSeek V3.2's likely desperation moves, yet competitive against Qwen 3's matching $70 bankroll."
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting $10 matches Kimi's bet to maintain competitive positioning while leaving room for recovery if needed, given my lower balance."

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 15 and the dealer showing a 4, the dealer is very likely to bust. Standing is the optimal strategy here as hitting risks going over 21, while the dealer's weak up card makes it safer to stay."
  Stands with 9♦ 6♠ (15)

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "With the chip lead at $90, I want to maintain pressure on Qwen 3 ($80) without risking significant damage to my stack. A $15 bet (17% of bankroll) balances aggression and preservation, keeping me ahead if I win while retaining $75 if I lose."
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2] bets $15

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15

zAI GLM: K♦ 10♦ (20)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer's 5 is a weak upcard with high bust probability (~42%); standing on hard 12 avoids the 40%+ chance of busting myself while forcing the dealer to hit into a potentially breaking hand."
  Stands with 5♥ 7♥ (12)
DeepSeek V3.2 [deepseek/deepseek-v3.2]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hard 13 against a dealer 5, doubling is statistically favorable as the dealer is weak and one more card likely improves or holds the hand."
  Doubled down, drew J♥ -> 3♦ K♥ J♥ (BUST 23) (Bet: $30)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown

=== New Round #14 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I'm slightly behind the chip leader ($110 vs $105), so a standard $10 bet allows me to potentially overtake on a win while preserving 90% of my stack if variance turns against me. This keeps pressure on Qwen 3 without risking the catastrophic loss that an all-in or large wager would invite at this stage."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $10 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a balanced risk level while staying competitive at the table. My balance is sufficient to absorb potential losses without compromising my overall strategy."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5

  Stands with 4♥ 8♣ (12)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand

  Stands with 8♣ J♣ (18)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows a weak 6, making a bust highly likely. Basic strategy dictates doubling soft 13 against a dealer's 5 or 6 to maximize profit."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on hard 13 against a dealer's weak 3 upcard. The risk of busting (38% chance) outweighs the marginal improvement potential, while the dealer must hit to 17 and has significant bust probability with this upcard."
  Stands with 3♥ 10♠ (13)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have a strong hand of 20, and the dealer shows a weak 3. Standing minimizes risk since the dealer is likely to bust or end up with a lower total. Additionally, another player already has blackjack, so I should avoid taking unnecessary risk."

=== New Round #16 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I'm only $5 behind chip leader Qwen 3, so a moderate $10 bet allows me to overtake them on a win while preserving bankroll if I lose. This positions me aggressively against the leader without risking too much against zAI GLM's short stack desperation plays."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $10 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, staying competitive without taking excessive risk given my $130 balance and the table's minimum of $5."

Qwen 3: 3♦ 6♦ (9)
zAI GLM: 2♠ Q♦ (12)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Soft 19 is a strong standing hand against any dealer upcard, including an Ace. Hitting risks downgrading to 12-18 with no chance to hit again, while doubling is inappropriate given the high probability of drawing a low card that weakens the hand."
  Stands with 8♦ A♥ (19 soft)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 9 against the dealer's Ace, hitting is the optimal strategy to improve my hand value. Standing or doubling down would be too risky given the dealer's strong up card."
  Drew 5♠ -> 3♦ 6♦ 5♠ (14)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 14 against the dealer's Ace, hitting is the optimal basic strategy decision to improve my hand value, as standing would leave me vulnerable to the dealer making 17 or higher, especially with a strong up card."

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand

  Stands with 3♦ 6♦ 5♠ 3♠ (17)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "The dealer's Ace is a strong up card, meaning a standing total of 12 will likely lose. I must hit to try and improve my hand to a competitive total."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "With a narrow $5 deficit to chip leader Qwen 3, betting $15 allows me to capture the lead on a standard win while the short-stacked zAI GLM likely plays defensively. This aggressive but controlled wager applies pressure without overexposing my bankroll to variance."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining competitive positioning at the table while keeping risk moderate given my $120 balance. This allows me to stay engaged without overextending."

  Stands with 10♦ J♠ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have a strong hand of 20, which is very close to the maximum possible score. The dealer shows a Jack, which is a strong upcard, but I do not need to risk busting by hitting. Standing is the safest and most strategic choice."
  Stands with J♥ 10♥ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 12 against a dealer's 10 or face card to maximize winning chances, as standing allows the dealer to win too often with a likely high total."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I need to close the $5 gap with Qwen without risking too much against zAI GLM's short stack. A $15 bet allows me to take the lead if I win while keeping 88% of my bankroll safe."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I match Kimi K2.5's bet of $15 to stay competitive at the table while managing risk, as my balance is slightly higher and I want to maintain a strong position without overextending."

  Stands with K♦ 9♦ (19)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows a 4, which is a weak up card, but my hand is 14, which is vulnerable to busting if I hit. However, with two strong players already at 19 and 20, standing on 14 risks losing even if dealer busts. Hitting gives me a chance to improve to a competitive hand without doubling down, which would be too risky given the high likelihood of busting with a 14."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 16 against the dealer's strong 10 upcard, hitting is the correct basic strategy play to improve my hand without risk of busting, whereas standing would likely lose to the dealer's probable 17+ total."
  Drew 5♣ -> A♥ 5♦ 5♣ (21 soft)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a total of 21, I have the optimal hand; hitting can only risk converting my Ace to 1 and lowering my total, whereas standing secures the strongest possible position against the dealer's 10 upcard."
  Stands with A♥ 5♦ 5♣ (21 soft)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 15 against the dealer's Queen, hitting carries significant risk of busting. Given that Kimi K2.5 already has 21 and zAI GLM has 14, standing minimizes risk while the dealer is likely to bust or tie with a high up-card."
  Stands with 5♣ Q♥ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 14 against dealer's Queen, basic strategy dictates hitting. Standing would likely lose against dealer's potential 20, and doubling down is too risky with this hand."

=== New Round #20 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "With the chip lead at $155, I will make a moderate 10% bet to maintain my advantage without risking significant exposure to the short-stacked zAI GLM, while keeping sufficient reserves for variance."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I am in a moderate position with $110, and betting $15 matches Kimi K2.5's bet to stay competitive without taking excessive risk. This allows me to maintain table presence while preserving capital."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Sticking to the minimum bet to preserve my limited bankroll while observing the table flow and the other players' outcomes."

Qwen 3: 6♣ K♦ (16)
zAI GLM: J♦ 2♦ (12)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a total of 20, I have a near-optimal hand. The dealer shows a weak 4, which puts them at high risk of busting. Standing preserves my strong position without risking a bust on a high card."
  Stands with Q♥ 10♠ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 16 and the dealer showing a 4, the dealer is likely to bust. Standing is the safest choice, especially with strong hands from other players (Kimi has 20, zAI has 12) that suggest the dealer may not have a strong hidden card."
  Stands with 6♣ K♦ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on hard 12 against a dealer's 4, as the dealer has a high probability of busting and hitting risks busting my own hand."

=== New Round #21 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With the chip lead at $155, I will apply moderate pressure while maintaining disciplined bankroll management. This bet size capitalizes on my advantage over Qwen 3 and zAI GLM without exposing me to excessive variance on a single hand."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I bet $10 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while managing risk, as my balance is moderate and I want to maintain table presence without overextending."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "To preserve my limited bankroll of $52 against variance, I will minimize risk by betting the table minimum."

zAI GLM: A♠ 10♥ (Blackjack)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 12 against a dealer's 3, as the dealer has a high probability of making a hand between 13-21, and 12 is too weak to stand pat. Standing risks losing to the dealer's made hand, while hitting gives me a chance to improve without an immediate bust risk being high enough to justify standing."
  Drew K♦ -> 9♥ 3♣ K♦ (BUST 22)
  Kimi K2.5 BUSTS!
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "The dealer shows a 3, which is a weak up card, but I have 15, and with two other players already bust or having blackjack, standing minimizes risk. Hitting 15 against a 3 is risky due to the 30%+ chance of busting, and doubling down would be suboptimal since I don’t have a strong hand to double on."

=== New Round #22 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $20
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with $145 against shorter stacks, I will place a confident $20 bet—large enough to capitalize on my bankroll advantage and pressure opponents playing with scared money, while keeping risk at a manageable 14% of my total balance."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I bet $15 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while managing risk given my $85 balance. This allows me to participate actively without exposing too much of my bankroll."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Betting the minimum to preserve my limited bankroll and withstand variance."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 13 against a dealer 2 is a standard hitting situation in basic strategy; I cannot bust by hitting and need to improve beyond 13 to beat the dealer's likely final hand."
  Drew 3♠ -> A♦ 2♠ 3♠ (16 soft)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 16 against a dealer 2 is a standard hitting situation in basic strategy; I cannot bust due to the Ace's flexibility and must improve beyond 16 to beat the dealer's likely final hand."
  Drew 6♠ -> A♦ 2♠ 3♠ 6♠ (12)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 12 against a dealer 2 is a standard hitting situation in basic strategy; hitting offers slightly better expected value than standing, and I must improve my hand to compete against the dealer's likely final hand."
  Drew A♣ -> A♦ 2♠ 3♠ 6♠ A♣ (13)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 13 against a dealer 2 is a standard standing situation in basic strategy; hitting risks busting with limited upside while the dealer must draw with unfavorable odds."
  Stands with A♦ 2♠ 3♠ 6♠ A♣ (13)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 16 against the dealer's 2, I should hit to improve my hand. The dealer is likely to bust or end up with a low total, but I have room to improve without risk of busting, and the soft ace gives me flexibility."
  Drew 6♠ -> 5♣ A♣ 6♠ (12)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 12 against the dealer's 2, I should hit. The dealer is very likely to stand with a low total, but my hand is too weak to stand confidently; hitting gives me a chance to improve without significant risk, as the dealer's 2 is a strong upcard for them to bust with."
  Drew 2♦ -> 5♣ A♣ 6♠ 2♦ (14)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 14 against the dealer's 2, I should hit. The dealer is likely to stand with a low total, but my hand is too weak to stand confidently; hitting gives me a chance to improve without significant risk, as the dealer's 2 is a strong upcard for them to bust with."
  Drew 3♥ -> 5♣ A♣ 6♠ 2♦ 3♥ (17)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 17 against the dealer's 2, I should stand. The dealer is likely to stand with a low total, and my hand is strong enough to hold without risk of busting, while the dealer has a high probability of ending up with a weak hand or busting if they hit."
  Stands with 5♣ A♣ 6♠ 2♦ 3♥ (17)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 16 against a dealer's 2 because the dealer's up card isn't weak enough to rely on them busting, making the risk of busting my own hand preferable to the likely loss of standing."
  Drew 5♦ -> Q♠ 6♦ 5♦ (21)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on 21 is the only correct play as any additional card will result in a bust, and the dealer cannot beat this hand without busting themselves."

zAI GLM: WIN! Wins $5 (New balance: $64)

=== New Round #23 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with $125 versus opponents at $85 and $64, I'm betting one conservative unit ($10) to maintain my bankroll advantage while establishing a steady baseline before adjusting for any card counting opportunities. This protects my lead against variance without bleeding chips at the minimum bet."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I bet $10 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a competitive presence at the table without overextending my $85 balance. This moderate bet balances risk and engagement with other players."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a lower bankroll than the other players, I will stick to the minimum bet to preserve capital and minimize variance. This conservative approach ensures I can withstand potential losing streaks."

Qwen 3: A♣ J♠ (Blackjack)
zAI GLM: 2♦ 10♠ (12)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 6 against the dealer's 7, basic strategy dictates hitting to improve the hand. While splitting 3s would be ideal against a 7, since that option isn't available, hitting is the correct play to avoid standing on a weak total."
  Drew 3♦ -> 3♣ 3♥ 3♦ (9)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 9 against dealer's 7 is a clear hitting situation per basic strategy; standing is too weak against a strong upcard, while hitting offers a path to 19-21 without risking a bust."
  Drew Q♥ -> 3♣ 3♥ 3♦ Q♥ (19)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 19 is a premium standing hand against a dealer 7; hitting risks an 85% chance of busting while the dealer must hit to 17 and frequently ends up with 17-18 or busts."
  Stands with 3♣ 3♥ 3♦ Q♥ (19)
Qwen 3 has Blackjack.
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 12 against a dealer's 7 because the dealer has a strong up card and is likely to make a standing hand, while standing on 12 offers very little chance of winning."
  Drew 9♦ -> 2♦ 10♠ 9♦ (21)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on 21 is the only correct play as hitting will result in a bust, and 21 is the highest possible hand total."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Maintaining chip lead with moderate bet size to preserve advantage over Qwen 3 and zAI GLM while limiting variance risk on a single hand."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $10 to maintain a competitive position at the table without risking too much of my balance, especially since Kimi K2.5 is already betting $10 and zAI GLM hasn't bet yet."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Matching the table bet size of $10 aligns with standard strategy while managing risk relative to my current bankroll."

Qwen 3: 7♦ 4♦ (11)
zAI GLM: 6♦ 10♦ (16)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 8 against the dealer's strong 9 upcard, basic strategy dictates hitting to improve the hand rather than doubling, as 8 is too weak to risk a double bet against a likely strong dealer hand."
  Drew 9♣ -> 2♥ 6♣ 9♣ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy mandates standing on hard 17 against a dealer 9 upcard. Hitting carries approximately a 69% risk of busting, which outweighs the limited upside of improving to 18-21."
  Stands with 2♥ 6♣ 9♣ (17)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 11 and the dealer showing a 9, doubling down is optimal as I have a strong chance to reach 21 or a high total, while the dealer is likely to bust or have a weak hand. The 11 is a classic doubling-down opportunity against a dealer's 9."
  Doubled down, drew 10♥ -> 7♦ 4♦ 10♥ (21) (Bet: $20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 16 against a dealer's 9, standing is likely a loss. Since surrender is not an option, hitting is the statistically correct play to try and improve the hand."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $10 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while managing risk, as my balance is moderate and I want to maintain flexibility for future hands."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5

  Drew 6♦ -> 4♠ 9♣ 6♦ (19)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 19 is a strong standing hand against any dealer up card; hitting risks an 85% chance of busting or staying at 19/20, while standing gives you a high probability of winning or pushing against the dealer's potential 17-20."
  Stands with 4♠ 9♣ 6♦ (19)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 9 against the dealer's 9, hitting is the best strategic choice to improve my hand. Standing or doubling down would be too risky given the dealer's strong up card and my low hand value."
  Drew 4♦ -> 7♣ 2♠ 4♦ (13)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $25
  Reasoning: "Holding the chip lead at $155 versus $110 and $54, I'm wagering $25 to extend my advantage while maintaining a safe buffer. This keeps me ahead of second place even if I lose, while capitalizing on wins to pressure shorter stacks."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25
  Reasoning: "I bet $25 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, staying competitive at the table without overextending my balance of $110. This moderate risk allows me to participate actively while preserving capital."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Hard 11 is a premium doubling hand against any dealer upcard 2-10; maximizing bet here exploits the high probability of drawing to 20/21 while the dealer must hit their 7 to 17."
  Doubled down, drew J♠ -> 4♣ 7♠ J♠ (21) (Bet: $50)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 15 against the dealer's 7, hitting carries risk of busting. However, seeing that Kimi already has 21 and zAI GLM has 14, the dealer is likely to draw and may bust or end up with 17-21. Standing preserves my hand and avoids unnecessary risk, especially since I’m already ahead of zAI GLM and can potentially win if the dealer busts or gets less than 15."
  Stands with K♠ 5♣ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows a strong 7, making a high total likely. Standing on 14 is a losing strategy against a 7, so I must take the risk to improve my hand."
  Drew 7♦ -> 8♦ 6♣ 7♦ (21)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have a total of 21, which is the best possible hand. Hitting would result in an automatic bust, so I must stand."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit

  Drew 5♣ -> 6♥ 10♦ 5♣ (21)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on a hard 21 is mandatory since any hit results in an automatic bust with zero probability of improvement, securing at minimum a push while the dealer attempts to reach 17-21."
  Stands with 6♥ 10♦ 5♣ (21)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 13 against the dealer's Jack, hitting is the optimal strategy to improve my hand without busting. The dealer has a strong up card, and I need to increase my hand value to compete, especially since Kimi already has 21 and zAI GLM is low."
  Drew A♥ -> A♥ 2♦ A♥ (14 soft)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit

  Drew Q♣ -> A♥ 2♦ A♥ Q♣ (14)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a soft 14 against the dealer's Jack, and having already hit twice without improvement, standing is optimal. The dealer is likely to have a strong hand (possibly 20 or 21), and I risk busting on another hit. Kimi already has 21, so I cannot beat them, but I can still push if the dealer does not improve."
  Stands with A♥ 2♦ A♥ Q♣ (14)

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 9 against the dealer's 6, I have a good chance to improve without busting. Hitting is optimal here as the dealer is likely to bust, and I can aim for a stronger hand to beat or tie Kimi K2.5's 19."
  Drew 4♥ -> 7♥ 2♠ 4♥ (13)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 13 against the dealer's 6, hitting is optimal as the dealer is likely to bust, and I have a reasonable chance to improve my hand without busting, especially since Kimi K2.5 already has 19, making it important to at least reach a competitive total."
  Drew 3♥ -> 7♥ 2♠ 4♥ 3♥ (16)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 16 against the dealer's 6, standing is optimal. The dealer is very likely to bust, and I avoid the risk of busting myself. Kimi K2.5 has 19, so I’m not aiming to beat them but to survive and potentially win if the dealer busts."
  Stands with 7♥ 2♠ 4♥ 3♥ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "A total of 6 is too weak to stand, and doubling is risky since a low card would leave me with a difficult hand. Hitting is the correct play to improve the hand value against the dealer's weak 6."
  Drew K♦ -> 2♦ 4♠ K♦ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "The dealer's 6 is a weak up card that often leads to a bust. Standing on 16 is the correct play to avoid the high risk of busting myself and to let the dealer try to beat my hand."
  Stands with 2♦ 4♠ K♦ (16)

zAI GLM: WIN! Wins $5 (New balance: $64)

=== New Round #29 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with $215, I can afford moderate aggression while zAI GLM's short stack of $64 may force desperate plays. Betting $15 maintains my advantage without overexposing my bankroll to variance."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a balanced approach to stay competitive without overextending my $145 balance. This allows me to participate actively while managing risk."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Betting the minimum to preserve bankroll and manage variance, as a larger bet would represent too high a risk percentage of my total funds."

Qwen 3: Q♦ Q♣ (20)
zAI GLM: 4♥ Q♥ (14)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Against a dealer's strong 10 upcard, basic strategy requires hitting a hard 13 to maximize expected value, as standing wins too infrequently while the risk of busting is outweighed by the need to reach a competitive total."
  Drew 7♥ -> 10♥ 3♦ 7♥ (20)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20 against a dealer's 10 upcard, standing is mandatory basic strategy; hitting risks busting on any card except an Ace (approximately 92% bust probability), while 20 already holds strong equity against a pat dealer hand."
  Stands with 10♥ 3♦ 7♥ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a strong hand of 20 and the dealer showing a King (which is a high card with a high chance of busting if they have to draw), standing is the optimal choice to avoid risking a bust. The other players also have strong hands, reinforcing the safety of standing."
  Stands with Q♦ Q♣ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 14 against a dealer King is a losing hand if I stand, so I must hit to try and improve my total."
  Drew 7♠ -> 4♥ Q♥ 7♠ (21)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have a hard 21, which is the best possible total, so I must stand to secure the win."

zAI GLM: WIN! Wins $5 (New balance: $69)

=== New Round #30 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with $230, I'm applying steady pressure with a $15 bet (3x minimum) to build my advantage over Qwen 3 and the short-stacked zAI GLM, while maintaining over 15 bets in reserve to weather variance."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a competitive position at the table without overextending my balance. This allows me to stay engaged in the game while managing risk appropriately."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "To preserve my limited bankroll of $69, I will bet the minimum while observing the table dynamics."
Dealer shows: 8♠ ??

zAI GLM: 4♥ 3♣ (7)
Kimi K2.5 has Blackjack.
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a 16 against the dealer's 8, hitting carries significant risk of busting, especially since the dealer has a strong chance to make 18-21. Since Kimi K2.5 already has blackjack, standing preserves my hand without risking a bust, and I can still potentially push or beat the dealer if they don't achieve blackjack."
  Stands with J♥ 6♣ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 7 against a dealer's 8, standing is mathematically unsound as the dealer will likely beat 7, and doubling is too risky. Hitting is the optimal play to improve the hand without fear of busting."
  Drew 3♥ -> 4♥ 3♣ 3♥ (10)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Standing on a hard 10 against a dealer's 8 is a losing play, and since doubling is typically not allowed on a three-card hand, hitting is the only strategic option to improve the total."
  Drew J♣ -> 4♥ 3♣ 3♥ J♣ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on a hard 20 is the only correct play; the high risk of busting far outweighs the minimal chance of improving to 21."
  Stands with 4♥ 3♣ 3♥ J♣ (20)

zAI GLM: LOSE (New balance: $64)

=== New Round #31 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "As chip leader with $252, I can afford moderate aggression to pressure Qwen 3 ($145) and the short-stacked zAI GLM ($64), while a $15 bet (6% of stack) preserves my advantage even if I lose."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining competitive positioning at the table while managing risk within my balance of $145."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting $10 balances risk management with the need to build my bankroll, matching the table's moderate aggression without overexposing my limited funds."

Qwen 3: A♣ 3♠ (14 soft)
zAI GLM: Q♠ 4♦ (14)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting hard 16 against a dealer's 10, as standing loses approximately 77% of the time while hitting provides a better chance to improve to a winning total despite the high bust risk."
  Drew 9♦ -> Q♣ 6♦ 9♦ (BUST 25)
  Kimi K2.5 BUSTS!
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 14 against the dealer's Queen, hitting is optimal to improve the hand without risking bust. The dealer is likely to have a strong hand (10 or 11), so improving my soft total increases my chances of winning or pushing."
  Drew 4♠ -> A♣ 3♠ 4♠ (18 soft)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a soft 18 against the dealer's Queen, standing is optimal. The dealer has a strong up card and is likely to have a high total, but my soft 18 is a strong hand that minimizes risk of bust and maximizes chance of winning or pushing."
  Stands with A♣ 3♠ 4♠ (18 soft)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 14 against a dealer's 10 to maximize winning chances, as standing is a losing play long-term."
  Drew 2♦ -> Q♠ 4♦ 2♦ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 16 against a dealer's 10, hitting is the statistically correct play to minimize long-term losses, as standing results in a loss against any dealer pat hand (17-21)."

=== New Round #32 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $25
  Reasoning: "Betting $25 (~10% of bankroll) maintains my chip lead over Qwen 3 while managing risk; zAI GLM's short stack suggests potential volatility ahead, so I avoid over-committing while building my advantage."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25
  Reasoning: "I bet $25 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while managing risk, as my balance is moderate and I want to maintain a strong position at the table without overextending."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a low bankroll of $54, betting the table minimum of $5 is the only mathematically sound move to manage variance and stay in the game."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Hard 10 against dealer 7 is a classic double-down situation in basic strategy, offering positive expected value by leveraging a strong draw to 20/21 against the dealer's weaker position."
  Doubled down, drew 6♠ -> 2♥ 8♦ 6♠ (16) (Bet: $50)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a strong hand of 19, and the dealer showing a 7, the probability of the dealer busting is low but not negligible. Standing preserves my current advantage without risking a bust, especially with other players holding 16 and 20."
  Stands with 9♦ Q♠ (19)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have a hard 20, which is a very strong hand that beats the dealer's potential 17. Hitting risks busting with almost any card, so standing is the only correct strategic move."

=== New Round #33 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with $287, betting $15 (~5% of bankroll) allows me to capitalize on favorable situations like splits and double-downs while maintaining a healthy edge over the short-stacked zAI GLM and applying pressure at the table."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a balanced approach that avoids excessive risk while staying competitive at the table. My balance of $185 allows for this moderate bet without jeopardizing my playing ability."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a low balance of $59, betting the minimum is the most prudent risk management strategy to preserve capital while gauging the shoe's flow."

Qwen 3: K♠ K♦ (20)
zAI GLM: 4♠ 6♠ (10)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer's 4 is a weak upcard with high bust probability; standing on hard 15 avoids risking self-bust while pressuring the dealer to break."
  Stands with 5♠ J♣ (15)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have a strong hand of 20, which is very close to the maximum possible value. The dealer shows a 4, which is a weak up card, making it unlikely they will bust. Standing preserves my strong position and avoids the risk of busting."
  Stands with K♠ K♦ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Hard 10 against a dealer's weak upcard of 4 is a prime doubling opportunity to maximize expected value, as the dealer is likely to bust."

=== New Round #34 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "With a commanding chip lead over Qwen 3 and zAI GLM short-stacked, I'm wagering 3 units to accumulate chips aggressively while keeping 50+ units in reserve to withstand variance and maintain my advantage."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I'm balancing risk and competitiveness by matching Kimi K2.5's bet of $15, which is above minimum but within a safe range given my $200 balance. This allows me to stay engaged without overexposing myself, especially with zAI GLM having a low balance and potentially playing conservatively."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "As the short stack with $49, I need to balance risk and recovery; betting $10 preserves my bankroll while offering better upside than the table minimum."

Qwen 3: 3♥ 3♦ (6)
zAI GLM: 6♠ 3♠ (9)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Dealer's 10-value upcard is strong, and standing on hard 16 loses approximately 77% of the time. Basic strategy dictates hitting to attempt improving the hand, despite the risk of busting."
  Drew 2♥ -> 9♥ 7♦ 2♥ (18)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 is a solid standing hand; hitting risks a ~77% chance of busting with minimal upside. Basic strategy mandates standing on hard 18 against a dealer 10, as the probability of busting exceeds the dealer's bust probability."
  Stands with 9♥ 7♦ 2♥ (18)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand total of 6 and the dealer showing a strong up card of Jack, hitting is the only viable option to improve my hand. Standing or doubling down would be extremely risky given the high probability of the dealer having a strong hand (likely 20 or 21)."
  Drew J♠ -> 3♥ 3♦ J♠ (16)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand total of 16 and the dealer showing a Jack, standing is the optimal choice. The dealer is likely to have a strong hand (possibly 20 or 21), and hitting would put me at high risk of busting. Given the current situation and the visible hands of other players, playing conservatively is the most strategic move."
  Stands with 3♥ 3♦ J♠ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 9 against a dealer's 10, as the dealer is strong and doubling down limits options if a low card is drawn."
  Drew 6♥ -> 6♠ 3♠ 6♥ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 15 against a dealer's 10 to minimize expected loss, as the dealer has a strong up card and standing is a losing play."
  Drew 5♠ -> 6♠ 3♠ 6♥ 5♠ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on a hard 20 is the only correct play; hitting offers minimal upside (only an Ace improves the hand) while posing a significant risk of busting."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I bet $10 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while managing risk, as my balance is moderate and I want to maintain table presence without overexposing myself."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hard 11 against a dealer 7, basic strategy maximizes expected value by doubling down to draw one card, leveraging the high probability of hitting 21 or a strong total while the dealer must hit to at least 17."
  Doubled down, drew 7♦ -> 6♥ 5♠ 7♦ (18) (Bet: $20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19, I have a strong hand that is unlikely to bust. The dealer shows a 7, which is a moderate up card, and I should stand to avoid risking a bust while having a high probability of winning or pushing."
  Stands with 9♥ K♦ (19)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy requires hitting a hard 12 against a dealer's 7 or higher to improve the hand, as standing is likely to lose against a strong dealer upcard."

=== New Round #36 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $20
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with a $292 stack, I maintain a significant advantage over Qwen 3 ($195) and the short-stacked zAI GLM ($69). Betting $20 represents approximately 7% of my bankroll, allowing me to build my lead on winning hands while maintaining a comfortable buffer against variance and potential all-ins from opponents."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I bet $20 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while managing risk, given my balance is lower than theirs but still healthy. This allows me to participate actively without exposing too much capital."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5

  Reasoning: "I have a strong hand of 20, and the dealer shows an 8, which is a moderate up card. With Kimi already having blackjack, I should not risk busting by hitting or doubling down. Standing preserves my hand and maximizes my chance to win if the dealer doesn't hit blackjack or bust."
  Stands with K♥ Q♦ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a low total of 7 against a dealer's 8, hitting is necessary to improve the hand, as standing guarantees a loss and doubling is too risky with such a weak starting value."
  Drew A♣ -> 3♦ 4♠ A♣ (18 soft)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on a soft 18 against a dealer's 8, as the risk of converting the hand into a hard total that requires further hits outweighs the potential benefit of improving to 19 or higher."

  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 against the dealer's weak 6 upcard, standing is the clear basic strategy play to maximize expected value; the dealer has a high probability of busting or finishing below 19, while hitting or doubling risks an 85% chance of busting with minimal upside."
  Stands with 9♦ J♠ (19)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 12 against the dealer's 6, hitting is the optimal basic strategy decision, as the dealer is likely to bust and I need to improve my hand to avoid losing to a higher dealer total."

=== New Round #38 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $25
  Reasoning: "With the largest stack at $342, I'm betting $25 (about 7% of my bankroll) to maintain my lead against Qwen 3 while preserving enough cushion if zAI GLM's short stack of $84 forces them to make desperate moves. This is aggressive enough to build my advantage without risking significant damage to my position."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25

  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 15 against a dealer's 9, as standing gives the dealer approximately 48% chance to already have 19-21 or draw to a stronger hand, whereas hitting improves my equity despite the bust risk."
  Drew A♠ -> 6♠ 9♠ A♠ (16)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Holding hard 16 against the dealer's 9 upcard requires aggressive play. Standing wins only when the dealer busts (~23% probability), while hitting offers a ~38% chance to improve to 17-21, making it the mathematically correct decision despite the significant bust risk."
  Drew 7♠ -> 6♠ 9♠ A♠ 7♠ (BUST 23)
  Kimi K2.5 BUSTS!
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand total of 6 against the dealer's 9, I must hit to improve my hand. Standing or doubling down would be extremely risky given the dealer's strong up card and my current low total."
  Drew 3♦ -> 2♠ 4♠ 3♦ (9)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand total of 9 against the dealer's 9, hitting is necessary to improve my position. Standing would be too risky given the dealer's strong up card, and I need to increase my hand value to avoid busting or losing to the dealer."
  Drew 3♠ -> 2♠ 4♠ 3♦ 3♠ (12)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand total of 12 against the dealer's 9, hitting is the most strategic choice. Standing risks losing to the dealer's likely strong hand, and while the risk of busting is present, the probability of improving to a competitive total (17+) is favorable."
  Drew 3♥ -> 2♠ 4♠ 3♦ 3♠ 3♥ (15)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand total of 15 against the dealer's 9, hitting is the better strategic choice. While there is a risk of busting, standing at 15 against a 9 gives a high probability of losing, as the dealer is likely to make 17+."
  Drew 5♠ -> 2♠ 4♠ 3♦ 3♠ 3♥ 5♠ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a strong hand total of 20 against the dealer's 9, standing is the optimal choice. The risk of busting by hitting outweighs the potential benefit, and 20 is a very competitive hand that is likely to beat the dealer's final total."
  Stands with 2♠ 4♠ 3♦ 3♠ 3♥ 5♠ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on a hard 20 is the optimal play; hitting risks an almost certain bust for minimal upside, and the dealer is unlikely to beat 20."

=== New Round #39 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "As chip leader with 63 minimum bets behind me, I'm wagering a conservative 3-unit bet to preserve bankroll against variance while maintaining pressure on the table, particularly against Qwen 3's $260 stack."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5’s bet, maintaining a competitive position at the table without taking excessive risk given my current balance of $260."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5

zAI GLM: 2♠ 8♣ (10)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With hard 12 against dealer's 10, basic strategy requires hitting to improve; standing risks losing to dealer's probable 20, and doubling stiff hands is incorrect."
  Drew 2♦ -> K♥ 2♠ 2♦ (14)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With hard 14 against the dealer's 10, basic strategy requires hitting to chase a competitive total; standing surrenders excessive equity against a strong upcard, and the potential to reach 17-21 outweighs the bust risk."
  Drew Q♦ -> K♥ 2♠ 2♦ Q♦ (BUST 24)
  Kimi K2.5 BUSTS!
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 17 against the dealer's Queen, standing is the optimal strategy. The dealer has a strong up card, but my hand is already in a safe position, and hitting risks busting."
  Stands with 7♥ J♠ (17)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 10 against a dealer's 10 is a standard hit; doubling is too risky against a strong upcard, and hitting allows flexibility to improve the hand without committing more money."
  Drew 4♣ -> 2♠ 8♣ 4♣ (14)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 14 against a dealer's 10 is a weak holding; standing usually results in a loss as the dealer is likely to make a hand, so hitting is the correct mathematical play to try and improve the total."
  Drew 6♥ -> 2♠ 8♣ 4♣ 6♥ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 20 is a premium hand; the risk of busting by hitting is far too high, and standing gives the strongest probability of winning against the dealer's Queen."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "With a slight chip lead over Qwen 3 ($302 vs $275), I need to maintain pressure while preserving bankroll against a desperate short-stacked zAI GLM. Betting 5% ($15) balances aggression with risk management."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a competitive position at the table without taking excessive risk given my balance of $275."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10

Qwen 3: 2♦ 4♥ (6)
zAI GLM: 6♦ 7♠ (13)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I hold a strong hard 18 against the dealer's weak 6 upcard. Standing maximizes my advantage since the dealer must hit and faces a high bust probability."
  Stands with 8♣ K♠ (18)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 6 and the dealer showing a 6, which is a weak up card, doubling down is optimal. The dealer has a high probability of busting, and I can improve my hand significantly with one card."
  Doubled down, drew Q♦ -> 2♦ 4♥ Q♦ (16) (Bet: $30)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "The dealer shows a weak 6, making a bust likely. Standing on hard 13 is optimal to avoid busting and letting the dealer take the risk."

=== New Round #41 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $20
  Reasoning: "Betting approximately 7% of my bankroll balances aggression with preservation, maintaining my chip lead over Qwen 3 while allowing zAI GLM's short stack to potentially bust before I take major risks."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I am betting $20 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while managing risk, as my balance is moderate and I want to maintain table presence without overexposing myself."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "My bankroll is significantly smaller than the other players', so I will bet a conservative $10 to manage variance while staying active at the table."

Qwen 3: 5♥ J♣ (15)
zAI GLM: 10♦ 3♣ (13)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 20 is an excellent standing hand against any dealer upcard; hitting risks busting on 12 of 13 possible cards while standing offers high probability of winning against dealer's 8."
  Stands with K♣ Q♦ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 15 against the dealer's 8, hitting carries risk of busting, especially since the dealer has a decent chance of making 18-21. Standing is safer, and with Kimi holding 20, the dealer is more likely to bust if they hit, making standing a conservative but sound choice."
  Stands with 5♥ J♣ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 13 against a dealer's 8, as the dealer has a strong up card likely to result in a standing hand, and standing on 13 is a losing proposition."
  Drew A♥ -> 10♦ 3♣ A♥ (14)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 14 against a dealer's 8, basic strategy requires hitting because the dealer has a strong up card likely to result in a standing hand of 17 or higher, making a 14 insufficient to win."
  Drew 2♠ -> 10♦ 3♣ A♥ 2♠ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 16 against a dealer's 8, as standing is a guaranteed loser against a likely dealer standing hand, and hitting offers the only chance to improve the total."

  Stands with 5♥ 9♦ (14)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows a 2, which is a weak up card, making it likely they will bust. With a hand of 15, standing is the safest choice to avoid going over 21, especially since other players also have 14-15 and are likely to stand or hit cautiously."
  Stands with 6♥ 9♠ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand

=== New Round #43 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "Betting 4.6% of my bankroll to establish a solid presence over Qwen 3 while preserving ammunition for favorable counts, as zAI GLM's depleted stack suggests potential table volatility."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15

  Drew K♥ -> 6♥ K♣ K♥ (BUST 26)
  Kimi K2.5 BUSTS!
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 12 against the dealer's 7, standing is risky as the dealer has a strong chance to make 17 or higher. Hitting gives me a chance to improve my hand without doubling down, which would be too aggressive with only 12."
  Drew 9♥ -> 4♥ 8♣ 9♥ (21)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have a strong hand of 21, which is the maximum possible without busting. Standing is the optimal choice as any further action risks busting, and I already have the best possible hand to beat the dealer's 7."
  Stands with 4♥ 8♣ 9♥ (21)

=== New Round #44 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $25
  Reasoning: "Betting roughly 8% of my $312 bankroll strikes a balance between capitalizing on my slight chip lead over Qwen 3 and maintaining a healthy cushion against variance. zAI GLM's short stack is irrelevant to my EV against the dealer, so moderate sizing is optimal."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25
  Reasoning: "I bet $25 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining competitive positioning at the table without overextending my $300 balance. This moderate bet allows me to stay engaged while managing risk effectively."

zAI GLM: Q♠ 9♠ (19)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 8 against dealer 5 calls for hitting under standard multi-deck basic strategy; doubling risks being stuck with a weak total (10-16) if dealt a low card, whereas hitting preserves flexibility to draw again if needed."
  Drew Q♦ -> 5♣ 3♠ Q♦ (18)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 against dealer 5 is a clear standing hand; hitting risks immediate bust on any Ten-value card while the dealer's weak upcard gives a ~42% bust probability, making pat the optimal play."
  Stands with 5♣ 3♠ Q♦ (18)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a soft 18 against the dealer's 5, standing is optimal as the dealer is likely to bust, and doubling down or hitting increases risk without significant gain."

zAI GLM: K♥ K♦ (20)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting hard 15 against a dealer's 10; standing risks losing to the dealer's likely strong hand (17-20), while hitting offers a chance to improve without excessive bust risk."
  Drew 4♥ -> J♠ 5♠ 4♥ (19)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 19 is a strong standing hand against a dealer 10; hitting risks busting on any card 5 or higher while offering minimal improvement potential, making standing the mathematically superior play to preserve a winning position against dealer 17-19 and push 19."
  Stands with J♠ 5♠ 4♥ (19)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 6 against the dealer's Queen, I must hit to improve my hand. The dealer is likely to have a strong hand (10 or Ace as hole card), but my hand is too weak to stand or double down safely."
  Drew Q♠ -> 3♦ 3♥ Q♠ (16)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 16 against the dealer's Queen, and seeing that other players have strong hands (19 and 20), it is prudent to stand. The dealer is likely to have a strong hand (possibly 20 or 19), and hitting risks busting with a high probability, especially with the dealer's up card being a Queen."
  Stands with 3♦ 3♥ Q♠ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand

  Reasoning: "As chip leader with $302, I'm betting $15 (5% of stack) to extend my $42 advantage over Qwen 3 while maintaining a safe buffer; this moderate sizing exploits zAI GLM's short-stack desperation without risking my table position to variance."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a balanced approach. This allows me to stay competitive without overextending my $260 balance, especially since zAI GLM hasn't bet yet and I want to observe the table dynamics before increasing risk."

  Reasoning: "I'm in a strong position with a balance of $250, and betting $15 matches Kimi K2.5's bet to stay competitive without taking excessive risk. This maintains table presence while preserving bankroll."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a limited bankroll of $59, I must minimize variance and preserve capital by sticking to the table minimum bet."

Qwen 3: J♦ 5♠ (15)
zAI GLM: 7♥ 10♦ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Hard 10 against dealer's weak 6 is a high-expectation double; strong chance to reach 19-20 while dealer faces high bust probability."
  Doubled down, drew 6♠ -> 3♦ 7♦ 6♠ (16) (Bet: $30)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows a 6, which is a weak up card with a high probability of busting. With a hard 15, standing is the optimal basic strategy decision, especially since other players have stronger hands (16 and 17) and I don't want to risk busting."
  Stands with J♦ 5♠ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on a hard 17 is the optimal play against a dealer's 6, as the dealer has a high probability of busting while hitting risks busting my own hand."

=== New Round #49 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "As chip leader with a $72 advantage over Qwen, I'm placing a conservative $15 bet to maintain pressure while preserving bankroll for variance, ensuring I can outlast the short-stacked zAI GLM."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a competitive position at the table without overextending my balance. This moderate bet allows for strategic play while keeping risk manageable."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "With a limited bankroll of $64, betting $10 balances risk and potential growth without overexposing funds like the larger stacks."

Qwen 3: 6♣ 3♦ (9)
zAI GLM: 2♣ J♣ (12)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 16 against dealer 3 requires a hit per basic strategy. Doubling is only recommended against 4-6, and standing leaves a weak hand. I cannot bust on the next card as the Ace can convert to 1."
  Drew 9♥ -> 5♥ A♣ 9♥ (15)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 15 against dealer's weak 3 is a stand per basic strategy; hitting risks a ~62% bust probability while the dealer must hit and may bust."
  Stands with 5♥ A♣ 9♥ (15)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 9 against the dealer's 3, hitting is optimal as the dealer has a high probability of busting, and I need to improve my hand to compete with other players who have stronger totals like 12 and 15."
  Drew 4♥ -> 6♣ 3♦ 4♥ (13)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 13 against the dealer's 3, hitting is still favorable because the dealer is likely to bust, and improving my hand increases my chances to beat other players who have 12 and 15. A 13 is vulnerable to higher totals, so drawing another card is strategically sound."
  Drew Q♦ -> 6♣ 3♦ 4♥ Q♦ (BUST 23)
  Qwen 3 BUSTS!
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 12 against a dealer's 3, as standing gives the dealer a high probability of making a valid hand while the risk of busting on a hit is manageable."
  Drew 5♠ -> 2♣ J♣ 5♠ (17)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates always standing on a hard 17, as the high risk of busting outweighs the low probability of improving the hand."

=== New Round #50 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $25
  Reasoning: "With the chip lead over Qwen 3 and a massive lead over zAI GLM, a moderate $25 bet preserves my advantage while allowing me to capitalize on favorable hands without risking significant damage to my stack."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $25 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining competitive presence at the table without taking excessive risk given my $250 balance."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With a relatively low bankroll of $74, betting the table minimum of $5 minimizes risk of ruin and allows for sustained play."

Qwen 3: K♥ 10♦ (20)
zAI GLM: Q♠ 5♦ (15)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer's 5 is a weak upcard with high bust potential; standing on hard 16 preserves my hand against their likely weak final total rather than risking a bust by hitting."
  Stands with K♠ 6♦ (16)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a strong hand of 20, I should stand to avoid busting. The dealer's up card is a 5, which is a weak card, so they are likely to bust, making standing the optimal choice."
  Stands with K♥ 10♦ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "The dealer's up card of 5 is weak, making a dealer bust likely. Hitting a hard 15 carries a high risk of busting, so it is strategically better to let the dealer play out their hand."

=== New Round #51 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $20
  Reasoning: "With the chip lead at $377, I will make a moderate $20 bet (roughly 5% of bankroll) to apply pressure while maintaining a healthy cushion against Qwen 3 and the short-stacked zAI GLM."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I'm betting $20 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while maintaining a conservative approach given my balance and the table's dynamics. This allows me to participate actively without excessive risk."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10

Qwen 3: 10♦ 5♠ (15)
zAI GLM: 5♣ 9♠ (14)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 against a dealer's weak 6 upcard, standing is the optimal play. Hitting risks busting while the dealer has a high probability of busting or finishing below 19."
  Stands with 9♥ 10♥ (19)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows a 6, which is a weak up card, but my hand is 15, which is a borderline standing hand. However, with Kimi K2.5 already at 19 and zAI GLM at 14, and considering the dealer is likely to bust, standing minimizes risk and capitalizes on the dealer’s vulnerability."
  Stands with 10♦ 5♠ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "The dealer has a weak upcard (6), so standing avoids the risk of busting my hard 14 while putting pressure on the dealer to bust."

=== New Round #52 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $20
  Reasoning: "Betting 5% of my bankroll aligns with proper bankroll management to withstand variance while maximizing expected value. This conservative sizing allows me to play optimally without risking ruin, regardless of the short-stacked players at the table."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20

  Stands with Q♣ 2♠ (12)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand

  Stands with 4♠ J♣ (14)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "The dealer has a weak upcard (6), making a bust highly likely. Hitting on a hard 16 carries a significant risk of busting, so standing is the optimal play to let the dealer potentially fail."

=== New Round #53 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $20
  Reasoning: "As chip leader, I should build my advantage conservatively without overexposing my stack. Betting $20 applies pressure on Qwen 3 while preserving 95% of my bankroll against variance and potential all-ins from short-stacked zAI GLM."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I'm betting $20 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while managing risk, as my balance is sufficient for this level of play without exposing myself to unnecessary loss."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10

Qwen 3: J♦ 6♦ (16)
zAI GLM: 4♦ 7♥ (11)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 6 against the dealer's strong 10 upcard, basic strategy mandates hitting to improve the hand. Doubling is incorrect here as the total is too low to risk additional money against a dealer likely holding 20."
  Drew Q♣ -> 2♦ 4♥ Q♣ (16)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a three-card hard 16 containing a 4 against the dealer's 10, composition-dependent basic strategy dictates standing, as the visible 4 reduces the probability of drawing a helpful card to reach 20 or 21 without busting."
  Stands with 2♦ 4♥ Q♣ (16)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 16 against the dealer's King, the risk of busting by hitting is high. Since the dealer has a strong up card (10-value), standing is the safer, more strategic choice to avoid busting while hoping the dealer also busts or has a lower hand."
  Stands with J♦ 6♦ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Hard 11 against a dealer's 10 is a mathematically optimal spot to double down, as the high probability of drawing a 10-value card to reach 21 offers the best expected value."

  Reasoning: "Betting 5% of bankroll aligns with professional bankroll management while maintaining chip lead flexibility against opponents with smaller stacks."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I'm maintaining a moderate bet to balance risk and reward, matching Kimi K2.5's bet to stay competitive without overextending my $295 balance. This allows for flexibility in future hands while keeping pace with the table."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "My bankroll is significantly smaller than the others; flat betting the minimum preserves capital and minimizes variance until the count becomes favorable."
Dealer shows: K♠ ??

Qwen 3: A♦ Q♣ (Blackjack)
zAI GLM: J♣ 10♣ (20)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 10 against the dealer's 10, basic strategy dictates hitting rather than doubling to maintain flexibility, as the dealer's strong upcard reduces the expected value of doubling down."
  Drew Q♥ -> 4♥ 6♦ Q♥ (20)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 20 against the dealer's 10, basic strategy requires standing; hitting offers minimal upside (only an Ace improves to 21) while carrying high risk of busting on any card valued 2 or higher."
  Stands with 4♥ 6♦ Q♥ (20)
Qwen 3 has Blackjack.
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on a hard 20 is the optimal play as the risk of busting is over 90%, and my hand is strong enough to beat all dealer draws except a dealer 20 or 21."

=== New Round #55 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $25
  Reasoning: "As chip leader with Qwen 3 only $92 behind, a moderate $25 bet maintains pressure while preserving bankroll to withstand variance. This strategic sizing prevents Qwen from closing the gap significantly on a single hand without risking my position."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25
  Reasoning: "I'm in a mid-range position with $325, and betting $25 matches Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining competitive presence without excessive risk. It's a balanced approach given the table dynamics and minimum bet requirement."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10

zAI GLM: 2♠ 7♠ (9)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 16 against a dealer 10 is a classic basic strategy hit. Standing wins only approximately 23% of the time, while hitting gives me a chance to improve to 17-21 despite the bust risk."
  Drew 5♣ -> Q♦ 6♠ 5♣ (21)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have achieved 21, the strongest possible hand. Hitting risks an automatic bust on any card drawn, while standing forces the dealer to play against a perfect total."
  Stands with Q♦ 6♠ 5♣ (21)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 12 against the dealer's 10, standing is risky as the dealer is likely to have a strong hand. Hitting improves the chance of reaching a competitive total without busting, especially since the dealer's up card is dangerous and other players have strong hands (like Kimi's 21) that may influence the game."
  Drew K♣ -> 8♦ 4♣ K♣ (BUST 22)
  Qwen 3 BUSTS!
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit

  Drew 4♠ -> 2♠ 7♠ 4♠ (13)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy requires hitting a hard 13 against a dealer's 10, as standing results in a likely loss against a strong dealer upcard, and hitting offers the only chance to reach a competitive total."
  Drew 3♦ -> 2♠ 7♠ 4♠ 3♦ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 16 against a dealer's 10, as standing is a losing proposition against a strong dealer upcard, and hitting offers the only chance to improve the hand or minimize the expected loss."
  Drew 3♠ -> 2♠ 7♠ 4♠ 3♦ 3♠ (19)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand

=== New Round #56 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $25
  Reasoning: "With the largest stack at $442, I maintain chip leadership while applying mild pressure. A $25 bet (~5.6% of bankroll) balances growth opportunity against variance, keeping me comfortably ahead of Qwen 3 ($300) without unnecessary risk."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a total of 20, only an Ace improves my hand while any other card busts me or leaves me worse off. Against a weak dealer 3, standing locks in a strong advantage as the dealer must hit and faces a high bust probability."
  Stands with K♦ J♣ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 10 against the dealer's 3, doubling down is optimal as the dealer is likely to bust and I have a high chance of improving to a strong hand (16-20) with one card. The low dealer upcard increases my advantage."
  Doubled down, drew 5♥ -> 5♣ 5♠ 5♥ (15) (Bet: $50)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: DoubleDown

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $25
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with $467, I will bet $25 to maintain my advantage through conservative bankroll management while keeping pressure on opponents with smaller stacks. This represents roughly 5% of my balance, allowing me to withstand variance over multiple hands."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $30
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with $442 against opponents holding $287 and $149, I'm betting conservatively to protect my advantage while forcing others to take bigger risks to catch up. A $30 wager keeps me comfortably ahead even if I lose, while maintaining enough skin in the game to extend my lead on a win."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I'm in a mid-range position with $287, not too high to be aggressive but not low enough to be passive. Betting $20 gives me a moderate risk exposure while allowing me to stay competitive against Kimi K2.5's $30 bet and maintain flexibility for future hands."

=== New Round #59 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $25
  Reasoning: "With the largest stack at $412, I'm betting roughly 6% to apply steady pressure on Qwen 3 and zAI GLM while preserving bankroll for table variance."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25
  Reasoning: "I bet $25 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining competitive table presence without overextending my balance. This balanced approach allows me to stay engaged while preserving capital for future hands."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $15
  Reasoning: "Betting $25 is too aggressive for my $139 bankroll, so I will stick to $15 to manage risk while maintaining a competitive presence at the table."

Qwen 3: 5♥ A♠ (16 soft)
zAI GLM: J♦ 7♦ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 9 against the dealer's strong 10 upcard, basic strategy dictates hitting to improve my hand rather than risking a double down against a likely high dealer total."
  Drew 5♦ -> 3♠ 6♦ 5♦ (14)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Against a dealer's 10 upcard, standing on hard 14 wins only when the dealer busts (roughly 23% of the time). Basic strategy dictates hitting despite the 62% bust risk, as the expected value of hitting exceeds that of standing pat against a likely strong dealer total."
  Drew 7♦ -> 3♠ 6♦ 5♦ 7♦ (21)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 21, hitting guarantees a bust with zero upside, while standing locks in the optimal hand against the dealer's 10 upcard, maximizing expected value."
  Stands with 3♠ 6♦ 5♦ 7♦ (21)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a soft 16 against the dealer's 10, hitting is the optimal strategy to improve my hand without the risk of busting. The dealer is likely to have a strong hand, and I need to increase my total to compete, especially with Kimi already at 21 and zAI at 17."
  Drew Q♠ -> 5♥ A♠ Q♠ (16)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I now have 16 (5♥ A♠ Q♠), and with the dealer showing 10, hitting again risks busting or not improving significantly. Kimi already has 21, and zAI has 17, so standing is the safer choice to avoid losing to a dealer 17 or 18 while minimizing risk against strong opponent hands."
  Stands with 5♥ A♠ Q♠ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 17 is a strong hand that should always be stood on against a dealer's 10, as the risk of busting by hitting outweighs the potential benefit of improving the hand."

=== New Round #60 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $20
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with a $145 advantage over second place, I'm placing a conservative 5% unit bet to minimize variance while maintaining pressure, forcing opponents to take larger risks if they want to close the gap."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I bet $20 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a competitive presence at the table without taking excessive risk given my current balance of $242."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting 8% of my bankroll to stay competitive with the table's pace while maintaining conservative bankroll management."

Qwen 3: 7♦ 6♠ (13)
zAI GLM: 6♥ 2♥ (8)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 7 against the dealer's strong 10, basic strategy mandates hitting to improve the hand. Doubling is incorrect with this weak total versus a powerful upcard, and standing would likely result in a loss."
  Drew 3♦ -> 4♣ 3♥ 3♦ (10)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 10 against the dealer's strong 10 upcard, standing is surrendering to likely defeat as the dealer probably holds 20. Basic strategy mandates hitting aggressively to improve toward 17-21, even at risk of busting, as 10 is insufficient to compete."
  Drew 6♥ -> 4♣ 3♥ 3♦ 6♥ (16)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Against a dealer's strong 10, basic strategy mandates hitting a hard 16 when surrender is unavailable; standing is statistically inferior as the dealer likely has 20, and the marginal chance to improve to 17-21 outweighs the bust risk."
  Drew 8♦ -> 4♣ 3♥ 3♦ 6♥ 8♦ (BUST 24)
  Kimi K2.5 BUSTS!
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 13 against the dealer's King, I should hit to improve my hand, as standing would be risky given the dealer likely has a strong hand (17+). The other players' bust or weak hands don't change my basic strategy."
  Drew 5♠ -> 7♦ 6♠ 5♠ (18)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 18 against the dealer's King, I should stand. The dealer has a high chance of having 17 or better, and I'm in a strong position to win unless they draw a 10 or Ace to make 20 or 21. Hitting risks busting with a high probability."
  Stands with 7♦ 6♠ 5♠ (18)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "My hand value of 8 is too weak to stand against a dealer's King, so I must hit to try and improve my total."
  Drew 6♠ -> 6♥ 2♥ 6♠ (14)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Standing on 14 against a dealer's King is statistically disadvantageous because the dealer has a high probability of making a strong hand. I must hit to try and reach a competitive total."

=== New Round #61 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $20
  Reasoning: "As chip leader with $367, betting approximately 5% of my stack maintains pressure while protecting against variance; this sizing keeps me well ahead of opponents without risking significant damage to my bankroll on a neutral count."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $20 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a moderate risk level while staying competitive at the table. This allows me to participate actively without overexposing my balance."

zAI GLM: Q♥ Q♥ (20)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 is a strong hand, and the dealer's weak 4 upcard gives them a high bust probability; hitting risks immediate bust while standing yields optimal expected value."
  Stands with 8♠ Q♦ (18)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 16 against the dealer's 4, standing is optimal because the dealer has a high probability of busting (4 is a weak upcard). Other players have strong hands (18 and 20), increasing the likelihood the dealer will bust, making it safer to stay."
  Stands with Q♦ 6♣ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Holding a hard 20 is a dominant position against a dealer's 4, and hitting or doubling down introduces unnecessary risk of busting with minimal potential gain."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with a significant cushion over Qwen 3 and zAI GLM, I'm wagering a conservative 4% of my stack to preserve my advantage while avoiding excessive risk against potentially desperate shorter stacks."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a competitive presence at the table without taking excessive risk given my balance of $202."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "With the lowest bankroll at the table, I must minimize variance to preserve my stack. Betting the minimum allows me to weather negative swings without risking my tournament life."

zAI GLM: Q♣ 4♥ (14)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Dealer's 10 is a strong upcard likely to make 17-20; standing on hard 14 has poor expected value while hitting provides a chance to improve the hand."
  Drew 7♣ -> K♦ 4♦ 7♣ (21)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 21 is the optimal hand; hitting guarantees a bust with any drawn card while standing provides the maximum possible value against the dealer's Q♥."
  Stands with K♦ 4♦ 7♣ (21)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 12 against the dealer's Queen (likely 10 or face card), hitting is the safest option. Standing risks losing to a dealer who may have a strong hand, and doubling down with 12 is too risky given the dealer's high up card."
  Drew 3♠ -> 3♦ 9♠ 3♠ (15)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 15 against the dealer's Queen (likely 20 or 21), hitting is too risky due to high bust probability. Standing minimizes loss, especially with Kimi K2.5 already having 21, and the dealer is likely to have a strong hand."
  Stands with 3♦ 9♠ 3♠ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 14 against a dealer's 10 to improve the hand, as standing is a losing play against a strong dealer upcard."
  Drew 3♥ -> Q♣ 4♥ 3♥ (17)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates always standing on a hard 17 to avoid the high risk of busting, as hitting offers very little chance of improvement against the dealer's 10."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "With a commanding chip lead of $332 against opponents at $187 and $109, I'm placing a conservative $15 bet to minimize risk while maintaining enough action to capitalize on favorable cards. This preserves my advantage and allows me to weather potential swings even if opponents make aggressive plays."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I'm betting $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a competitive position without overextending my balance. This allows me to stay engaged in the game while managing risk appropriately."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5

zAI GLM: 6♠ Q♦ (16)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Holding 11 against the dealer's 10 is a classic doubling situation per basic strategy. Roughly 30% of remaining cards are ten-value (giving me 21), and any 6 or higher improves me to 17+, making the extra bet profitable long-term despite the dealer's strength."
  Doubled down, drew 10♣ -> 6♥ 5♦ 10♣ (21) (Bet: $30)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a soft 17 against the dealer's King, standing is optimal as the dealer is likely to have a strong hand (10 or higher), and hitting risks busting. Kimi already has 21, so I should avoid unnecessary risk."
  Stands with 6♣ A♠ (17 soft)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15

zAI GLM: 2♠ 10♠ (12)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Hard 9 against a dealer's 3 is a favorable situation per basic strategy; the dealer's weak upcard creates high bust potential, making it profitable to double the bet for one card."
  Doubled down, drew 8♦ -> 6♠ 3♣ 8♦ (17) (Bet: $30)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 14 against the dealer's 3, standing is optimal because the dealer has a high probability of busting (low up card), and hitting risks going over 21. The other players' hands (12 and 17) don't change the fundamental strategy here."
  Stands with 4♥ K♦ (14)

  Stands with Q♦ 7♦ (17)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 14 against the dealer's 7, I should hit to improve my hand. The dealer is likely to stand on 17 or higher, and my 14 is too low to stand safely. The other players have strong hands (17 and 19), but I must focus on improving my own position."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 7 against the dealer's strong 9, basic strategy dictates hitting to improve this weak total. Standing on 7 is mathematically inferior, and doubling down is only recommended with totals of 9, 10, or 11."
  Drew J♦ -> 2♠ 5♦ J♦ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 17 against a dealer 9 is a clear standing hand in basic strategy; hitting risks busting on any card 5 through King (69% probability), making standing the mathematically superior play despite the dealer's strong upcard."
  Stands with 2♠ 5♦ J♦ (17)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 16 against the dealer's 9, hitting carries significant risk of busting. Since Kimi K2.5 already has 17 and zAI GLM has 16, standing is a conservative but strategic choice to avoid going over 21 while the dealer still has a strong chance to bust or improve."

zAI GLM: 7♦ 9♥ (16)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 12 against the dealer's 3, as standing risks losing to the dealer's potential 17+ while hitting offers a chance to improve without excessive bust risk."
  Drew 3♥ -> 2♦ J♣ 3♥ (15)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on hard 15 against a dealer's 3; hitting risks busting on 7-K (approx. 54% chance), while the dealer must hit to 17 and may bust with their weak upcard."
  Stands with 2♦ J♣ 3♥ (15)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 13 against the dealer's 3, I should hit to improve my hand, as the dealer is likely to bust with a low up card, and I have a good chance to reach a strong total without going over 21."
  Drew 7♠ -> 6♦ 7♣ 7♠ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a strong hand of 20 against the dealer's 3, standing is optimal. The dealer is likely to bust, and improving the hand risks going over 21."
  Stands with 6♦ 7♣ 7♠ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "The dealer shows a weak 3, creating a high probability of them busting. Hitting a hard 16 is too risky, so standing preserves my bankroll and forces the dealer to make a hand."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 is a strong hand against a weak dealer 4 upcard. Hitting risks busting or lowering my hand value with minimal upside, while the dealer has a high probability of busting or finishing below 18."
  Stands with 8♠ J♣ (18)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 17 and the dealer showing a 4, the dealer has a high probability of busting. Standing preserves my hand, especially since other players have strong hands (18 and 20), and I don’t need to risk going over 21."
  Stands with 10♥ 7♠ (17)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit

Qwen 3: 10♣ 2♥ (12)
zAI GLM: 4♣ 2♦ (6)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 17 against the dealer's weak 5 upcard, basic strategy mandates standing. The dealer has a high probability of busting (≈42%), while hitting risks immediate bust on any card 6 or higher."
  Stands with 8♥ 9♥ (17)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 12 against the dealer's 5, I should hit because the dealer is in a weak position (5 is a high bust card) and I have a good chance to improve my hand without going over 21. Standing or doubling down would be too risky with such a low hand value."
  Drew 8♥ -> 10♣ 2♥ 8♥ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a strong hand of 20 against the dealer's 5, standing is optimal. The dealer has a high bust probability with a 5 showing, and I risk busting if I hit, so I should lock in my strong position."
  Stands with 10♣ 2♥ 8♥ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "My hand total of 6 is too weak to stand or double down effectively. I must hit to improve my hand against the dealer's vulnerable up card of 5."
  Drew K♣ -> 4♣ 2♦ K♣ (16)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand

=== New Round #73 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $30
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with $312, betting 10% of my stack applies pressure on the shorter stacks while preserving my advantage. This $30 bet is substantial enough to capitalize on favorable situations without risking my dominant position."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I am in a mid-range position with $157, and betting $20 allows me to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5's $30 bet while managing risk. This moderate bet maintains table presence without overextending my bankroll."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting $10 strikes a balance between growing the bankroll and managing variance, as matching the higher bets of opponents would be too risky with a $104 balance."

Qwen 3: 7♣ 6♣ (13)
zAI GLM: 3♥ 8♠ (11)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 8 against the dealer's strong 10 upcard, I must improve my hand. Basic strategy dictates hitting rather than doubling, as 8 is too low to risk a double against a ten-value card."
  Drew 9♦ -> 2♣ 6♥ 9♦ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy mandates standing on hard 17 against any dealer upcard, including a 10. Hitting risks busting with any card 6 or higher (roughly 62% probability), while 17 is a competitive total that wins if the dealer busts or finishes with 16 or less."
  Stands with 2♣ 6♥ 9♦ (17)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 13 against the dealer's King (a high card), hitting is the correct basic strategy decision to improve my hand. Standing would be too risky given the dealer is likely to have a strong hand (17-21), and doubling down is not advisable with 13."
  Drew 7♥ -> 7♣ 6♣ 7♥ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 20 against the dealer's King, standing is the optimal basic strategy decision. The dealer is likely to have a strong hand (17-21), and hitting would risk busting."
  Stands with 7♣ 6♣ 7♥ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "Doubling down on hard 11 against a dealer's 10 maximizes expected value, offering a high probability of reaching 20 or 21 without risk of busting."

  Kimi K2.5 BUSTS!
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 13 against the dealer's 9, hitting is the best strategic choice. Standing risks losing to a dealer who is likely to make 17-21, while doubling down is too risky with only a 13. Hitting allows me to improve my hand without committing extra chips."
  Drew J♠ -> 5♥ 8♠ J♠ (BUST 23)
  Qwen 3 BUSTS!
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit

  Drew 2♠ -> 2♦ Q♥ 2♠ (14)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 14 against a dealer's 9, as standing results in a loss too frequently against such a strong upcard."
  Drew A♦ -> 2♦ Q♥ 2♠ A♦ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit

zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows a 6, which is a weak up card with a high probability of busting. With a hand of 13, standing is a safe and strategic choice to avoid busting while letting the dealer potentially bust."

  Drew A♦ -> K♠ 6♥ A♦ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With hard 17 against a dealer 7, basic strategy mandates standing; hitting risks a 69% chance of immediate bust while standing preserves a competitive total where the dealer must hit and risks busting."
  Stands with K♠ 6♥ A♦ (17)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a soft 17 against the dealer's 7, standing is optimal. The dealer has a high chance of making 17-21, and I avoid risking busting by hitting. Double down is not suitable with a soft 17."

zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit

  Drew 2♦ -> 9♣ 7♣ 2♦ (18)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 is a strong standing hand against a dealer 7; hitting risks busting on 40 of 52 possible cards while the dealer has a 26% bust rate and frequently stops at 17, which I beat."
  Stands with 9♣ 7♣ 2♦ (18)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 13 against the dealer's 7, hitting is the optimal strategy as the dealer has a high chance of making 17 or higher, and standing at 13 risks busting if the dealer improves. Doubling down is not favorable here due to the high risk of busting with a single card."
  Drew A♥ -> 3♦ K♠ A♥ (14)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 14 against the dealer's 7, standing is the optimal decision. The dealer has a high probability of making 17 or higher, and hitting 14 risks busting, especially with other players already showing strong hands (18)."
  Stands with 3♦ K♠ A♥ (14)

zAI GLM: 7♣ K♠ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Dealer's 9 is a strong upcard that will likely reach 19+. Basic strategy dictates hitting hard 16 against a 9, as standing wins only ~23% of the time while hitting improves my chances to beat the dealer's probable total."
  Drew 2♦ -> J♠ 6♥ 2♦ (18)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 is a strong pat hand where hitting risks busting on approximately 77% of remaining cards (4 through K) while only improving to 19-21 with an Ace, 2, or 3. Basic strategy dictates standing on hard 18 against a dealer 9, as the high bust probability outweighs the marginal gains from hitting."
  Stands with J♠ 6♥ 2♦ (18)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 13 against the dealer's 9, hitting is the optimal strategy as the dealer has a strong up card and my hand is too low to stand. Doubling down is not advisable at 13, and standing would likely result in losing if the dealer makes 17+."
  Drew Q♣ -> Q♦ 3♦ Q♣ (BUST 23)
  Qwen 3 BUSTS!
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on all hard 17s, as the high risk of busting outweighs the potential for improvement against the dealer's 9."

=== New Round #80 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $10
  Reasoning: "As chip leader with $267, I have a $98 advantage over second place. Betting $10 (3.7% of bankroll) applies gentle pressure while preserving my lead through conservative bankroll management."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $10
  Reasoning: "I bet $10 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while managing risk, as my balance is moderate and I want to maintain steady play without overextending."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Matching the table standard bet of $10 to maintain consistent risk while engaging with the current game flow."

Qwen 3: 9♥ 4♦ (13)
zAI GLM: 9♥ 7♦ (16)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard total of 7 against the dealer's 7, I must hit to improve my hand. Standing is too weak against a strong dealer upcard, and doubling down is not recommended with this low total against a 7."
  Drew J♣ -> 5♣ 2♦ J♣ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 17 against the dealer's 7, standing is the optimal play to avoid the high probability of busting while forcing the dealer to play out their hand."
  Stands with 5♣ 2♦ J♣ (17)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 13 against the dealer's 7, hitting is the optimal basic strategy decision. The dealer has a strong chance of making 17 or better, and standing with 13 risks busting if the dealer improves."

=== New Round #81 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "With a $98 lead over the nearest competitor, I'm betting moderately to maintain pressure while protecting my stack; this 6% bankroll wager lets me extend my lead on a win without significant damage on a loss."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I bet $15 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5, who has already bet that amount, while maintaining a conservative approach given my balance of $159 and the minimum bet requirement of $5."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting $10 balances risk management with table dynamics, keeping the wager under 10% of the bankroll while staying competitive with the other players."

Qwen 3: 3♣ 7♦ (10)
zAI GLM: 10♠ 3♠ (13)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Against a dealer 10, basic strategy requires hitting a hard 13 to improve the hand, as standing leaves me vulnerable to the dealer's likely strong total, while doubling is inappropriate for this weak starting hand."
  Drew 6♣ -> 8♦ 5♠ 6♣ (19)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 19 against a dealer 10, basic strategy mandates standing; hitting risks busting on any card except an Ace or 2 (approximately 77% chance of busting), while 19 is already a strong total that wins unless the dealer has 20 or 21."
  Stands with 8♦ 5♠ 6♣ (19)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 10 and the dealer showing a King (strong up card), doubling down is optimal as I have a good chance to reach 20 or 21 with one card, while the dealer is likely to stand on 17 or higher."
  Doubled down, drew K♠ -> 3♣ 7♦ K♠ (20) (Bet: $30)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Holding a hard 13 against a dealer's strong upcard of 10 requires hitting to improve the hand, as standing is mathematically likely to result in a loss against a dealer potential 20."
  Drew 2♣ -> 10♠ 3♠ 2♣ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Holding a hard 15 against a dealer's 10 is a weak position; hitting is statistically necessary to improve the hand, as standing results in a high probability of losing against a strong dealer upcard."
  Drew 6♥ -> 10♠ 3♠ 2♣ 6♥ (21)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Holding 21 is the best possible hand; hitting would result in an immediate bust, so standing is the only correct move."

zAI GLM: WIN! Wins $10 (New balance: $119)

=== New Round #82 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "As chip leader with $242 against opponents at $159 and $119, I'm betting $15 (6% of stack) to apply moderate pressure while maintaining a comfortable cushion. This protects my lead if I lose and extends it if I win, without risking significant damage to my bankroll."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I bet $15 to stay competitive with Kimi K2.5 while managing risk, as my balance is lower than theirs but still sufficient for moderate play. This bet size allows me to participate actively without overexposing my bankroll."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $15
  Reasoning: "Matching the $15 bet of the other players aligns with the table flow and represents a moderate risk relative to my bankroll."

Qwen 3: 10♥ 5♣ (15)
zAI GLM: K♣ 3♥ (13)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Dealer's 9 is a strong upcard requiring me to hit hard 14 to improve; standing gives poor odds against likely 19+ total."
  Drew 3♠ -> Q♣ 4♥ 3♠ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 17 is a mandatory standing hand in basic strategy; hitting risks immediate bust on 62% of remaining cards while the dealer's 9 upcard has significant bust potential, making the stand the mathematically superior play."
  Stands with Q♣ 4♥ 3♠ (17)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 15 against the dealer's 9, hitting carries significant risk of busting. Given that Kimi K2.5 has 17 and zAI GLM has 13, standing is the safer choice to avoid busting while hoping the dealer busts or stays under 17."
  Stands with 10♥ 5♣ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 13 against a dealer's 9, as standing is likely to lose against a strong upcard and doubling is too risky."

=== New Round #83 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader, I will apply moderate pressure with a $15 bet—large enough to build my lead against shorter stacks but conservative enough to preserve my advantage if I lose."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet and maintain a competitive position at the table without risking a significant portion of my balance. This allows me to stay engaged while preserving capital for future hands."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Betting $10 preserves bankroll while maintaining aggression, as matching the $15 bets of others would be too risky with my current balance."

Qwen 3: 10♥ Q♠ (20)
zAI GLM: 7♥ 8♠ (15)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 8 against the dealer's weak 6 upcard, basic strategy dictates hitting to improve my hand. While the dealer has a high bust probability with a 6, my total of 8 is too low to stand, and doubling is only recommended for 9-11 or soft hands."
  Drew 8♣ -> 3♦ 5♣ 8♣ (16)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on hard 16 against a dealer's 6 upcard. The dealer has a high bust probability (~42%) with a 6 showing, making it statistically favorable to stand and let them potentially break rather than risk busting myself by hitting."
  Stands with 3♦ 5♣ 8♣ (16)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a strong hand of 20, it is optimal to stand regardless of the dealer's 6, which is a weak up card. The risk of busting by hitting outweighs any potential gain, and the dealer has a high probability of busting themselves."
  Stands with 10♥ Q♠ (20)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "The dealer's upcard of 6 indicates a high probability of busting, so it is strategically optimal to stand on my hard 15 rather than risk busting myself by hitting."

=== New Round #84 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "With a $272 stack leading the table, I'm betting 3 units ($15) to apply pressure on shorter stacks while keeping risk at a disciplined 5.5% of bankroll. This sizing maintains my edge without exposing me to significant variance on any single hand."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a competitive position without excessive risk, given my balance and the table dynamics."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Betting the minimum to preserve bankroll, as $5 represents approximately 4.4% of my funds, adhering to conservative risk management principles."
Dealer shows: 8♦ ??

Qwen 3: 2♣ 9♥ (11)
zAI GLM: A♣ 5♦ (16 soft)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 18 is a strong hand against a dealer 8. Hitting risks busting on any 9 through King, while standing preserves a solid chance to win or push against the dealer's potential 18-19."
  Stands with 8♠ K♦ (18)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 11 against the dealer's 8, doubling down is optimal as the dealer has a high probability of busting or ending up with a low total, and I have a strong chance to improve to 21 or a high winning hand with one card."
  Doubled down, drew K♣ -> 2♣ 9♥ K♣ (21) (Bet: $30)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 16 is too weak to stand against a dealer's 8, as the dealer likely makes 18 or better. Hitting allows for improvement without the risk of busting on the first card."
  Drew 2♠ -> A♣ 5♦ 2♠ (18 soft)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 18 against a dealer's 8 is a weak holding that loses more often than it wins if standing. Hitting allows for improvement to 19, 20, or 21 without the risk of busting."
  Drew 6♦ -> A♣ 5♦ 2♠ 6♦ (14)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 14 is too weak to stand against a dealer's 8, as the dealer has a strong chance of making a hand of 18 or better. Hitting is the correct mathematical play to improve the hand, despite the risk of busting."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $20

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I'm betting $20 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, which maintains a competitive presence at the table without taking excessive risk given my balance of $219. This allows me to stay engaged while preserving capital for future hands."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 19 is a strong standing hand against any dealer upcard; hitting risks an 85% chance of busting or weakening the hand, and doubling down on 19 is never strategically correct."
  Stands with 9♠ K♥ (19)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 14 against the dealer's 2, hitting is optimal because the dealer is likely to bust (they must hit to 17), and I have a reasonable chance to improve my hand without going over 21. Standing or doubling down would be too risky given the low dealer upcard."
  Drew 3♦ -> 6♥ 8♠ 3♦ (17)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 17 against the dealer's 2, standing is optimal. The dealer is likely to bust, and improving my hand further risks going over 21, especially with a strong hand already."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $5
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with a comfortable margin over both opponents, betting the minimum preserves my advantage while forcing short-stacked players to take bigger risks to catch up. Conservative sizing minimizes variance and maintains strategic pressure."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $5

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a pair of aces (soft 12) against the dealer's weak 4, splitting is the optimal play but unavailable; hitting is superior to standing on 12 or doubling, as I need to improve this weak total while retaining flexibility with the soft hand."
  Drew K♠ -> A♥ A♦ K♠ (12)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 12 against the dealer's weak 4, basic strategy mandates standing to avoid the ~31% risk of busting; the dealer must hit until 17 and has high bust probability from this position."
  Stands with A♥ A♦ K♠ (12)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have a strong hand of 20, which is very close to the maximum possible value. The dealer shows a 4, which is a weak upcard, making it unlikely they will bust. Standing preserves my strong position without risking going over 21."

  Drew 8♠ -> 3♥ 3♦ 8♠ (14)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit

  Drew 3♥ -> 3♥ 3♦ 8♠ 3♥ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand

  Doubled down, drew 4♦ -> 2♦ 9♠ 4♦ (15) (Bet: $30)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a soft 16 against the dealer's 9, doubling down is optimal as it maximizes expected value. The dealer has a high chance of making 19-21, but my ace gives me flexibility to improve to 18-21 with a single hit."

zAI GLM: WIN! Wins $10 (New balance: $114)

=== New Round #89 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $20
  Reasoning: "As chip leader with $277, I'm betting $20 to maintain pressure while keeping 93% of my bankroll protected. This sizing ensures I stay ahead of Qwen 3 ($214) even if they win a big hand and I lose, while allowing me to extend my lead against the short-stacked zAI GLM ($114)."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I am in a moderate position with $214, and betting $20 matches Kimi K2.5's bet, allowing me to stay competitive without taking excessive risk. This maintains table engagement while preserving capital."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Betting the minimum to manage bankroll variance, as matching the $20 bets would risk too high a percentage of my total funds."

zAI GLM: 6♣ 10♥ (16)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 10 against the dealer's strong 10 upcard, basic strategy requires hitting rather than doubling to maintain flexibility; if I draw a low card, I can hit again to improve toward 20 or 21."
  Drew A♦ -> 6♦ 4♦ A♦ (21 soft)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Standing on 21 is mandatory; hitting risks busting or reducing my total when I already hold the maximum safe hand against the dealer's 10 upcard."
  Stands with 6♦ 4♦ A♦ (21 soft)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 11 against the dealer's Queen, doubling down is optimal as the dealer has a high chance of busting or having a strong hand (likely 20 or 21), and I have a good chance to reach 21 or close with one card. The high probability of success with a single card makes doubling down the best strategic choice."
  Doubled down, drew 5♥ -> 6♥ 5♦ 5♥ (16) (Bet: $40)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 16 against a dealer 10 is a weak hand. Since Surrender is not an option, hitting is statistically superior to standing to minimize losses."

Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25
  Reasoning: "I bet $25 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a competitive position without overextending my balance. This allows me to stay engaged in the game while managing risk appropriately."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $15

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 6 against the dealer's 10, basic strategy requires hitting to improve my hand; standing guarantees a loss against likely dealer totals of 17-20, while doubling a 6 versus a strong dealer card carries negative expected value."
  Drew 6♦ -> 4♦ 2♠ 6♦ (12)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 12 against the dealer's 10, basic strategy mandates hitting to improve my hand; standing leaves me vulnerable to the dealer's likely 17-20, while hitting offers a chance to reach a competitive 17-21 despite the risk of busting."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "As the chip leader with $272, I'm placing a moderate $15 bet to maintain my advantage over Qwen 3's $211 stack while practicing sound bankroll management against the short-stacked zAI GLM."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15

Qwen 3: J♠ 8♣ (18)
zAI GLM: A♠ 3♣ (14 soft)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates standing on hard 14 against a dealer's weak upcard (2-6) to avoid the risk of busting; the dealer must hit to at least 17 and has approximately a 35% chance of busting with a 2 showing."
  Stands with 9♥ 5♣ (14)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With 18 against the dealer's 2, standing is optimal as the dealer is very likely to bust and I have a strong hand. There's no benefit to risking a bust by hitting or doubling down."
  Stands with J♠ 8♣ (18)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 14 is too weak to stand against a dealer's 2, and doubling is too risky; hitting offers the best chance to improve the hand without doubling the bet on a marginal situation."
  Drew Q♠ -> A♠ 3♣ Q♠ (14)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a hard 14 against a dealer's 2, as standing is too weak to win against the dealer's likely drawing hand and the risk of busting is necessary to improve the total."
  Drew A♠ -> A♠ 3♣ Q♠ A♠ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 15 against a dealer's 2, basic strategy dictates standing to avoid the high risk of busting, as the dealer's weak upcard does not require taking a hit to improve."

=== New Round #92 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "Betting roughly 6% of my bankroll manages variance effectively while applying slight pressure on Qwen 3; this sizing ensures I remain chip leader even if I lose and they win their hand."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I choose to bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a competitive position without taking excessive risk given my balance and the minimum bet requirement."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $15
  Reasoning: "Betting $15 to align with the table average and maintain a balanced risk profile relative to my bankroll."

Qwen 3: 5♣ Q♠ (15)
zAI GLM: 5♦ Q♠ (15)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting hard 15 against a dealer's 10, as standing loses approximately 54% of the time while hitting reduces the expected loss. With four 10-value cards already visible among the players, the remaining deck is slightly less dangerous for hitting."
  Drew 6♦ -> Q♦ 5♥ 6♦ (21)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "I have a perfect 21; hitting guarantees a bust while standing gives me the strongest possible hand against the dealer's 10."
  Stands with Q♦ 5♥ 6♦ (21)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 15 against the dealer's 10, hitting carries significant risk of busting. However, seeing that Kimi K2.5 already has 21 and zAI GLM also has 15, standing minimizes risk and avoids busting, especially since the dealer is likely to have a strong hand given the 10 up card."
  Stands with 5♣ Q♠ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Hard 15 against a dealer's 10 is a weak position; since surrender is unavailable, hitting is statistically correct to minimize losses compared to standing, as the dealer has a high probability of making a hand."

=== New Round #93 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "With a narrow $31 lead over Qwen 3 and zAI GLM sitting on a short stack, I'm making a conservative 5.5% bet to protect my chip advantage while maintaining flexibility to adjust if Qwen bets aggressively."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a balanced approach—neither too aggressive nor too conservative—while staying within my comfort zone and preserving my bankroll."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $5
  Reasoning: "Betting the minimum preserves bankroll against the higher-stakes players, minimizing variance while waiting for a favorable count or a winning streak."

Qwen 3: 6♠ A♥ (17 soft)
zAI GLM: A♣ 6♦ (17 soft)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 20 is a premium standing hand against any dealer upcard. Hitting risks busting on 92% of remaining cards, while doubling down on 20 is mathematically incorrect regardless of the dealer's card."
  Stands with 10♥ J♦ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a soft 17 against the dealer's 7, standing is optimal as the dealer has a good chance of making 17-21, and I avoid the risk of busting. Other players have strong hands (20 and soft 17), which supports a conservative play."
  Stands with 6♠ A♥ (17 soft)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Basic strategy dictates hitting a Soft 17 against a dealer's 7 to improve the hand, as standing is a losing position and doubling is too risky against a strong upcard."
  Drew 2♣ -> A♣ 6♦ 2♣ (19 soft)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Soft 19 is a strong hand that beats a dealer's 7 unless they draw to 20 or 21; hitting risks converting a winning position into a losing one."

=== New Round #94 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $25
  Reasoning: "As chip leader against a short-stacked zAI GLM and close competitor Qwen 3, betting $25 (roughly 9% of bankroll) applies pressure while maintaining a healthy lead and protecting against variance."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25

=== New Round #95 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $20
  Reasoning: "As chip leader with $337, I should minimize variance against the short-stacked zAI GLM ($84); a $20 bet allows for splits and doubles while preserving bankroll if the dealer catches a hot shoe."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $20
  Reasoning: "I'm betting $20 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, maintaining a competitive position without overextending my balance. This allows me to stay engaged in the game while keeping risk moderate."

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard total of 6 against the dealer's strong 8, basic strategy requires hitting to improve the hand rather than standing on a guaranteed losing total or risking a double down on a weak starting hand."
  Drew 8♦ -> 2♠ 4♠ 8♦ (14)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 14 against the dealer's 8, basic strategy dictates hitting. The dealer's 8 is a strong upcard likely to result in 18+, making standing on 14 a losing proposition long-term despite the bust risk."
  Drew J♠ -> 2♠ 4♠ 8♦ J♠ (BUST 24)
  Kimi K2.5 BUSTS!
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit

  Qwen 3 BUSTS!
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit

  Drew 3♥ -> 5♥ 7♦ 3♥ (15)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "A dealer's 8 is a strong up card that often results in a high total. Standing on 15 is a losing proposition, so I must hit to try and improve my hand to a competitive total."
  Drew 6♥ -> 5♥ 7♦ 3♥ 6♥ (21)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand

zAI GLM: 8♦ 9♥ (17)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 20 is a premium standing hand; hitting risks busting on any card except an Ace (12/13 chance), while doubling down is never correct with this total. Basic strategy mandates standing against any dealer upcard."
  Stands with K♥ K♣ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 17 and the dealer showing an 8, standing is the optimal strategy as the dealer has a moderate chance of busting but also a decent chance of making 18-21. Given that other players have strong hands (20 and 17), it's safer to hold rather than risk busting."
  Stands with Q♦ 7♦ (17)

  Stands with Q♥ K♠ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Dealer shows a 6, which is a weak up card, but my hand is 14, which is below the typical standing threshold. Since I have a pair of 7s, hitting allows me to potentially improve to a stronger hand without committing to double down, which carries higher risk against a dealer with a 6."
  Drew 5♦ -> 7♠ 7♦ 5♦ (19)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Stand

Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $15
  Reasoning: "Betting $15 represents roughly 4% of my bankroll, allowing me to withstand variance while maintaining pressure on opponents. This conservative approach preserves my slight chip lead over Qwen 3 and forces the short-stacked zAI GLM to take bigger risks to catch up."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $15
  Reasoning: "I bet $15 to match Kimi K2.5's bet and maintain a competitive position at the table without taking excessive risk, given my balance of $293."

Kimi K2.5: Q♠ Q♦ (20)
Qwen 3: 6♥ 4♠ (10)
zAI GLM: 2♣ A♥ (13 soft)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "Hard 20 is one of the strongest hands in blackjack; standing maximizes expected value against dealer 8, while hitting or doubling risks busting or reducing hand strength for minimal gain."
  Stands with Q♠ Q♦ (20)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: DoubleDown
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 10 against the dealer's 8, doubling down is optimal as the dealer has a high probability of busting or ending up with a weak hand, and I have a strong chance to improve to 20 or 21 with a single card."
  Doubled down, drew 4♣ -> 6♥ 4♠ 4♣ (14) (Bet: $40)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 13 is too weak to stand against a dealer 8, and basic strategy dictates hitting rather than doubling down to improve the hand without risking extra funds on a strong dealer upcard."
  Drew 4♦ -> 2♣ A♥ 4♦ (17 soft)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Soft 17 is a losing hand against a dealer's 8 if stood upon, so hitting is necessary to try and improve to 18 or better without the risk of busting."
  Drew 5♦ -> 2♣ A♥ 4♦ 5♦ (12)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hard 12 against a dealer's 8, standing is a losing play as the dealer has a high probability of making a strong hand; hitting is required to try and improve, despite the risk of busting."
  Drew 9♠ -> 2♣ A♥ 4♦ 5♦ 9♠ (21)
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 21, hitting is impossible without busting, so standing is the mandatory move to secure the win against the dealer's 8."
  Stands with 2♣ A♥ 4♦ 5♦ 9♠ (21)

Dealer reveals: 8♥ 7♥ (15)

zAI GLM: WIN! Wins $10 (New balance: $94)

=== New Round #100 ===
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5] bets $25
  Reasoning: "Betting approximately 7% of my bankroll maintains pressure on the table while preserving sufficient reserves for doubles, splits, and variance. As chip leader, this sizing protects my advantage against Qwen 3 without risking significant exposure to zAI GLM's likely desperate play."
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct] bets $25
  Reasoning: "I'm betting $25 to match Kimi K2.5's bet, which is a moderate risk given my balance of $268, allowing me to stay competitive at the table without overexposing myself."
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7] bets $10
  Reasoning: "Sticking to a conservative 10% bet size to manage bankroll volatility effectively while observing the table flow."
Dealer shows: A♥ ??
Kimi K2.5: 7♠ 6♠ (13)
Qwen 3: 2♠ J♥ (12)
zAI GLM: 9♠ 6♦ (15)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Hit
  Reasoning: "Dealer's Ace is a dangerous upcard likely to result in a strong hand, and standing on hard 13 gives insufficient winning equity. Hitting is the optimal basic strategy play to attempt improving the hand despite the risk of busting."
  Drew 8♣ -> 7♠ 6♠ 8♣ (21)
Kimi K2.5 [moonshotai/kimi-k2.5]: Stand
  Reasoning: "With a hard 21, I have the maximum non-busting value possible. Hitting guarantees a bust with any card, while standing offers the best mathematical expectation against the dealer's Ace, either winning outright or pushing if the dealer also reaches 21."
  Stands with 7♠ 6♠ 8♣ (21)
Qwen 3 [qwen/qwen3-vl-32b-instruct]: Hit
  Reasoning: "With a hand of 12 against the dealer's Ace, I must hit to avoid busting on a dealer's likely 17-21. The dealer has a strong up card, and standing or doubling down would be too risky."
  Drew Q♠ -> 2♠ J♥ Q♠ (BUST 22)
  Qwen 3 BUSTS!
zAI GLM [z-ai/glm-4.7]: Hit
  Reasoning: "The dealer's Ace is the strongest upcard, and standing on 15 would result in a loss the majority of the time; since surrender is unavailable, hitting is the only statistically viable option to improve the hand."
  Drew 8♣ -> 9♠ 6♦ 8♣ (BUST 23)
  zAI GLM BUSTS!

Dealer reveals: A♥ 4♦ (15 soft)
